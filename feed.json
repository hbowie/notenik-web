						"title": "Changing Adventure URLs",
						"content_html": "<p>I&#8217;m making a few updates to the <em>Adventures</em> blog. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The blog post URLs are changing. I had previously been prefixing each post with the date of the post, followed by the title. As things evolved, though, I realized I wanted to use wiki links between some of the entries, and the date prefixes made it harder to translate these links from the Notenik collection to the actual website. Also, I realized that, as these posts began to evolve, I really wanted each post to have a unique title anyway. So the dates are gone. And good riddance, I say. But if you&#8217;ve bookmarked any of these, then you&#8217;ll need to update your bookmarks. Sorry for my lack of prescience on this issue. </p></li>\n<li><p>On the Notenik Discourse forum, @ThePrinter made the <a href=\"https://discourse.notenik.app/t/outlining-with-notenik/530/2?u=hbowie\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">excellent suggestion</a> of modifying the HTML title of each post to place the title of the post before the name of the blog, to make it easier to distinguish between tabs, when viewing more than one. This too has been implemented. </p></li>\n<li><p>I had previously been offering two different versions of the blog page, one with full posts, and one only with summaries of each post. But the wiki links between posts also proved problematic when showing a page of full posts, so I&#8217;ve eliminated this version. (I&#8217;d grown to prefer the summaries page anyway; hopefully others feel the same.) </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hopefully none of these changes will prove too disruptive for anyone, and together I hope they will smooth the path to continued useful evolution of these <em>Adventures</em>. </p>",

						"title": "Automatically Incrementing Sequence Numbers",
						"content_html": "<p>This post is part of an evolving series that can somewhat usefully be read in order. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"outlining-with-notenik.html\" class=\"wiki-link\">Outlining with Notenik</a> </li>\n<li>Automatically Incrementing Sequence Numbers (this post) </li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Upon first consideration, having to manually wrangle sequence and level numbers in order to create an outline might seem unnecessarily difficult. </p>\n\n<p>And so it would be, were it not for a number of convenient features that Notenik supplies specifically for working with outlines. </p>\n\n<p>The first group of these helps by automatically incrementing sequence numbers. </p>\n\n<p>This can work in three somewhat distinct ways. </p>\n\n<p>First, if you position the current Note selection (using any of the views on the left of the Collection Window), and then request the addition of a New Note (which can be done most readily with the keyboard shortcut of CMD-N), you will see that your Seq value has been automatically incremented for you, and the Level value set to match the preceding Note — the one you initially selected. And so you can easily continue adding Notes to an outline without having to worry about Seq and Level numbers. Nifty! </p>\n\n<p>Second, if you instead use the <code>New Note w/Options</code> item (just beneath the <code>New Note</code> item described above, towards the top of the <code>Note</code> menu, and easily accessible with a keyboard shortcut of OPT-CMD-N), you will see a little window allowing you to enter several fields at once. You can enter the Title of the Note, along with the Level and Seq fields. But here you will also see <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> keys that can be used to increment/decrement the Level value and — as you do so — the Seq field will be automatically adjusted to fit into the appropriate numbering sequence for the chosen Level! This can be super handy when you are adding Notes in sequence, but they are not all at the same level of indention. Click <code>OK</code> when you are done, and then your values will be pre-populated on the Edit tab for you. </p>\n\n<p>And then, third, as a minor variation of the second option, if you click on the <code>Again</code> button instead of the <code>OK</code> button, you can skip the Edit tab, have Notenik add the Note for you —with just the fields you have entered in the <code>New Note with Options</code> window — and then immediately return to the <code>New Note with Options</code> window to add the next Note. This can be especially handy when you are trying to quickly capture the bare bones of an outline, with just Title fields and positions, leaving the possibility of fleshing out additional details later. </p>\n\n<p>So there you have it! Three ways to have Notenik automatically increment your Seq values, without you having to manually enter any value other than the first! </p>",

						"content_html": "<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned previously, Notenik supports <a href=\"lets-talk-metadata.html\" class=\"wiki-link\">metadata</a>. And different sorts of fields can be used for different purposes. </p>\n\n<p>In many cases, you will want to sort the Notes in a Collection by some <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/field-labels-and-types.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">field</a> that contains data about the Note — something like Title or Author or Date, let&#8217;s say. </p>\n\n<p>In other cases, though, you will want to impose some organizational sequence on a Collection of Notes based on the relationship between the Notes, or on some logical sequence that is not apparent from any of the metadata about the Note. </p>\n\n<p>This is when you would want to use the <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/seq.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seq</a> field. </p>\n\n<p>A Seq field contains artificial values — values that you assign simply to get your Notes into whatever sequence is meaningful to you. </p>\n\n<p>As you&#8217;re assigning such values, you will want to change the Sort sequences for your Collection to <code>Seq + Title</code>, or some other sort sequence making use of the Seq field, so you can see your Notes in the sequence you have assigned to them. </p>\n\n<p>And then, to refine this approach a bit more, you can use the <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/level.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Level</a> field to organize some Notes as being subordinate to others. </p>\n\n<p>By combining these two fields — Seq and Level — you can structure your Notes into a hierarchy usually referred to as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">outline</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When fashioning an outline, you will generally want your Seq values to reflect your outline structure. That is, you will want your top level Notes to be numbered consecutively and then, within each parent item, you will want your children numbered consecutively, with a period (aka <em>dot</em> or <em>full stop</em>) separating each parent number from the numbering of its children. This numbering can be done recursively, to as many levels as you would like. </p>\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll note that the <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-knowledge-base.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Notenik Knowledge Base</a> is structured in this fashion, using an outline. The Knowledge Base is one of several Notenik Collections stored within the <code>NotenikDocs</code> repo on GitHub. You can always download the repo from <a href=\"https://github.com/hbowie/NotenikDocs\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub</a> if you&#8217;d like to inspect a working example of such an outline. </p>\n\n<p>As it happens, Notenik seems to support Seq numbering in conformance with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_2145\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ISO 2145</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Oh and by the way, feel free to use upper- or lower-case letters [a..z] instead of numbers, if you would like. </p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll share more Notenik outlining tips in future Adventures, but this should be enough to whet your appetite. </p>",

						"content_html": "<p>The basic <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">syntax of Markdown</a> is easy to learn and invariant across many parsers &#8211; which explains the popularity of this writing tool in a nutshell. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, many people have created <a href=\"https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">extensions</a> to the original tool as a means of solving many common problems, and many of these extensions have also been implemented consistently across a number of popular parsers. </p>\n\n<p>And, of course, Notenik implements almost all of this. </p>\n\n<p>But Notenik version 15.0.0 has just been released and, in addition to fixing a few bugs, this new release adds a new Markdown extension to solve a recurring problem that still seems to be outstanding. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the problem. </p>\n\n<p>HTML offers the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blockquote</a> tag to allow a quotation to be distinguished from surrounding text, and this tag can be easily styled with CSS. </p>\n\n<p>And standard Markdown implements a <a href=\"https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">handy convention for generating blockquotes</a>, so all is well here. </p>\n\n<p>The problem arises when an author wants to provide a nicely formatted attribution line following the quotation, indicating its source. </p>\n\n<p>Because here there is no special HTML tag nor any Markdown syntax to provide any help. </p>\n\n<p>Nor is there any overall consensus on the best way to format such a commonly seen line, even when dropping down out of Markdown into HTML. </p>\n\n<p>I like to include quotations in my writing on a regular basis, so I&#8217;ve been working aound this issue for some time now. </p>\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve finally created a new Markdown extension to help address this problem. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the simplest form of such an attribution: </p>\n\n<pre><code>{:quote-from:George Bernard Shaw}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s the way it would look, when expanded by Notenik, following the appropriate quotation. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>You see things; and you say, &#8216;Why?&#8217; But I dream things that never were; and I say, &#8216;Why not?&#8217; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"quote-from\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">George Bernard Shaw</a>, 1921, from the play <cite>Back to Methuselah</cite></p>\n\n<p>Note that, in this case, I&#8217;ve included other information, in addition to the author&#8217;s name, so that the full Markdown would look like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>{:quote-from:George Bernard Shaw|1921|Play|Back to Methuselah|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw|}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All the details can be found in the <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/format-a-quote-citation.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Knowledge Base</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Notenik also provides some default CSS styling for both the <code>blockquote</code> tag, and for the <code>quote-from</code> class that is applied to the paragraph element enclosing the citation text, to make everything line up nicely, and to provide the leading em dash. But of course this can be overridden by the user for their particular application. </p>\n\n<p>I hope others make use of this as much as I know I will! </p>",

But then, many sites seem to make things up, or repeat things that have been heard elsewhere, even if they <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/collections/albert-einstein-collection/\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have no basis in fact</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So I generally like to capture the year in which the quotation was first published or recorded, along with its original source. <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wikiquote</a> is often a good source for this information. But of course, if you&#8217;re capturing an entry as part of your own reading of a source, that additional data is already readily available. </p>\n\n<p>And then, of course, you can try to categorize each entry as it is made. I&#8217;ve found this to be a very useful exercise, partially because it helps me to think more deeply about the import of each quotation. In Notenik, the <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/tags.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tags</a> field can be used for this purpose. Notenik allows multiple tags to be assigned to each entry, and also supports nested tags. You probably don&#8217;t want to go overboard with tagging, but I would certainly recommend some level as a way to make your growing collection both more interesting and more useful. </p>\n\n<p>One additional consideration is whether you want your commonplace to be stored in a single collection, or in a series of related collections. For example, Notenik allows the user to create a <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/commonplace-with-lookups.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commonplace with Lookups</a>, in which both Authors and their Works are stored in separate collections. The advantage of this sort of setup — especially if you want to collect additional info about authors, and about their works — is that such data then only needs to be entered once, and can then simply be referenced if you have multiple entries from the same author,  and/or from the same work. </p>\n\n<p>Notenik offers a <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/fields-useful-for-reviews-citations-and-quotations.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">number of different field types</a> that can be used as part of a commonplace book, whether you use lookups <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/commonplace-book.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">or not</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But then, what can you do with this additional data, once you start collecting it? Well, that will be the subject of our next post. </p>",

And I had an older Mac App, written in Java, called <a href=\"https://macdownload.informer.com/iwisdom/\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iWisdom</a>, that was designed specifically for this purpose. </p>\n\n<p>Based on my own experience, my recommendation is for everyone to start and continue to maintain their own commonplace book, for all of the following reasons. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>It encourages one to read — the most important way of expanding one&#8217;s knowledge and perspectives. </p></li>\n<li><p>It makes one a more active and engaged reader. </p></li>\n<li><p>It forces one to be selective, since the act of transcribing a quotation from its original source takes some time and effort, and is not worth doing for every bit of text one runs across. In other words, it encourages us to separate the wheat from the chaff. </p></li>\n<li><p>The result is a continually growing record of what one has read, and a resource of words that have had some particular meaning for us. </p></li>\n<li><p>The ability to refer back to such a collection has enduring value for thinkers and writers interested in organizing and distilling important ideas, and synthesizing new ones. </p></li>\n<li><p>For all of us, as we mature, such a collection can serve as an important reminder of the words that have had meaning for us over the years, and an opportunity to reflect on the significance of these thoughts in our own lives. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll have more to say about &#8220;commonplacing with Notenik&#8221; in several follow-on posts, but this one will hopefully serve as an introduction to the series. </p>",

But basically these are just three different, but very similar, ways of supporting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name–value_pair\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">name-value pairs</a> within text files that also contain Markdown. </p>\n\n<p>But there is a difference between Notenik&#8217;s use of metadata vs. the way this info is used in other apps. </p>\n\n<p>In all cases, metadata supplies variables that can be used when formatting a Markdown document. </p>\n\n<p>But with Notenik: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Each different collection of text files, stored in its own folder,  can have its own specific definition of the types and names of fields to be found within that collection; </p></li>\n<li><p>The metadata is used, not just to format and identify documents, but as a means of <em>organizing</em> the files within a collection, so that the collection itself becomes an entity with its own characteristics. Add a date field, and then you can sort by date. Add an author field, and you can sort by author. Add a status field, and you can separate completed items from ones still in work. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Metadata is the basis of many of Notenik&#8217;s most powerful functions, so it&#8217;s good to get a handle on what it is and how it can be used. </p>",

If you&#8217;re not sure where to find a particular menu item, you can enter a search word or phrase here, and immediately see a list of menu items containing that search term. Enter additional text to further refine your search. Hover over a line in the search results to see where it can be found in the menu structure, and to see its keyboard shortcut, if there is one. Click on one of those items to select it. </p>\n\n<p>This menu search feature offers another handy way to explore and leverage Notenik&#8217;s extensive main menu structure. </p>\n\n<p>Keyboard shortcuts and menu search &#8211; two helpful macOS functions that are always available within Notenik when you need them. </p>",

In this case the merge template file must be named <code>display.html</code> and placed in the same folder as the Notes themselves. For this type of merge template, there should be no <code>output</code> command at all, since the output will be routed by Notenik to its own internal Display tab. </p>\n\n<p>The second type of merge template is used to produce a list or index containing multiple occurrences of Notes. For this type, the <code>output</code> command is typically placed at the very beginning of the template file, and specifies a static output directory and file name. </p>\n\n<p>The third type of merge template is used to produce one output file per input Note. For this type, the <code>output</code> command is placed after the <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/nextrec-command.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nextrec command</a>, and the <code>output</code> file name contains one or more variable fields, so that each Note&#8217;s information will be placed in its own file. </p>\n\n<p>The second and third types are typically both used when creating a website. </p>",

						"content_html": "<p>I 've used Notenik to build several websites. Here are a few examples: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reasontorock.com\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reason to Rock</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://softdevbigideas.com\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Software Development Big Ideas</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://practopian.org\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Practical Utopian</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lexiconofsong.com\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lexicon of Song</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hbowie.net\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">H. Bowie</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s a general workflow for building such sites, with indications of where Notenik can be used. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-identify-types-of-content\">1. Identify Types of Content</h3>\n\n<p>For any website, you will have one or more types of content. For a simple blog, for example, you will have blog posts. Where Notenik excels, though, is in building sites with more complex content types, and with multiple types. But you need to start out by identifying these. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-identify-organizational-schemes\">2. Identify Organizational Schemes</h3>\n\n<p>How will you present your content to site visitors? A blog typically shows the latest post, followed by more recent ones, plus some sort of archive access. Depending on your content type(s), different means of filtering and ordering your content may be appropriate. Figure out what makes the most sense for your site. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-identify-fields-for-each-content-type\">3. Identify Fields for each Content Type</h3>\n\n<p>What information do you want to present? What sorts of data may benefit from separate handling? What fields will you need for filtering and sorting, based on your organizational schemes? </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-figure-out-where-to-store-everything\">4. Figure Out Where to Store Everything</h3>\n\n<p>When building a website, I typically don&#8217;t use the default location of the iCloud Notenik folder, because I end up with many different folders that I need to access in a variety of ways. The Sites folder within your home folder (as a peer to your Documents folder) is the traditional location for website stuff. If it doesn&#8217;t already exist, then create it, and then create a subfolder for your site, and everything related to it. Then create a <code>content</code> folder. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-build-your-notenik-collections\">5. Build Your Notenik Collections</h3>\n\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to build the Notenik Collections that will house your content. Typically you would want a separate Collection for each content type although, in some cases, it might be beneficial to house them all in one Collection, with a different <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/class.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Class</a> value for each different content type. If in doubt, though, start with a separate Collection for each content type. Place all of these Collections within the <code>content</code> folder you created above. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"6-implement-version-control\">6. Implement Version Control</h3>\n\n<p>I would typically use Git, and use Tower as my Git client. But once you start creating files within your site&#8217;s folder, you probably want to use some sort of version control, and start checking stuff in regularly. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"7-identify-your-web-page-layouts\">7. Identify Your Web Page Layouts</h3>\n\n<p>These would typically include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A page for each content type, showing one Note within that Collection </li>\n<li>One or more index pages listing multiple instances of a particular content type </li>\n<li>A home page for your site, with navigational links leading to the other pages </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Figure out what you want each page to look like. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"8-create-notenik-merge-templates\">8. Create Notenik Merge Templates</h3>\n\n<p>Now create a <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Merge Template</a> for each page layout. These would contain HTML tags, as well as your Merge Commands and Merge Variables. You would create these with your trusty text editor. Typically I would place these in a folder named <code>templates</code>, within a folder named <code>factory</code>, which would be a peer to the <code>content</code> folder you created earlier. It is the templates that specify the names and location of the actual web pages being created. Typically I would put these in a folder called <code>web</code>, that would be a peer to my <code>content</code> and <code>factory</code> folders. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"9-create-and-run-notenik-scripts\">9. Create and Run Notenik Scripts</h3>\n\n<p>Finally create and run your <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/script-files.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Script Files</a>. Your script files pull everything together, reading from your Collections, sorting and filtering those Notes, and then using your templates to generate actual web pages. I would put these into a <code>scripts</code> folder that would be a peer to your <code>templates</code> folder, and also within the <code>factory</code> folder. Your script files will typically contain many steps. I often use Notenik to create the first step, and then go back to my trusty text editor to create others, copying and pasting and tweaking as I go. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"10-test-and-tweak\">10. Test and Tweak</h3>\n\n<p>In this phase you run your scripts and tweak your content and templates until you are happy with the results. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"11-upload-to-a-web-server\">11. Upload to a Web Server</h3>\n\n<p>When everything looks the way you would like, you will want to upload the web pages to your actual site that is resident on an actual web server. I use Transmit as my FTP client, and use A2 Hosting for my web server, but there are many other choices available. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"12-maintain-and-enhance\">12. Maintain and Enhance</h3>\n\n<p>At any point after initial publication, can can add new content to your Collections, and tweak your templates, then rerun your scripts, then upload changes to your web server. Each time you run your scripts your entire site will be rebuilt. However script execution should happen in only a few seconds. </p>",

In other words, if the import data set has some fields not already present in the primary Collection (the one to be updated with the import data), how should Notenik handle these? And there are two possible answers. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ignore the additional fields. </li>\n<li>Add the additional fields to the primary Collection. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>What to do with additional rows/lines/record/notes? And there are three options here. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add – Add all the rows in the import file to the primary Collection. </li>\n<li>Match and Add – Use the primary Collection&#8217;s definition of key fields (Title, by default) to try to match imported items with existing items: if a match is found, then use the imported data to update the existing Note to match; if no matching key is found, then add the imported item to the Collection. </li>\n<li>Match Only – Use the matching logic and update matching Notes, but discard any additional input items that do not already have a match. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>What to do with data from obtained from <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/lookup.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lookup fields</a> found in a Notenik Collection being imported? And there are two possible answers: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ignore the referenced data </li>\n<li>Consolidate it, by treating the looked up field labels and values as if they were part of the imported collection. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>How might one use this match-merge feature? </p>\n\n<p>I have one Collection I update on a monthly basis with the latest info available from a website. The website offers an option to download data in CSV format, so after downloading the file, I then import it into my Collection. In this case, I don&#8217;t want to add any additional fields, but do want to match and update my existing Notes. After the import, I&#8217;ve got the latest data in my Notenik Collection! </p>\n\n<p>Something else I tried recently was importing my <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/commonplace-with-lookups.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commonplace with Lookups</a> collection of quotations into a new Collection that did not rely on Lookups (making it more portable). In this case I just created a new Collection of <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/basic-notes.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Basic Notes</a>, and then performed the import, asking to add additional fields, to match and add the additional rows, and to consolidate lookups.  This one quick import then magically transformed my basic notes collection into a fully-populated Commonplace book without any dependencies on other Collections referenced via lookup fields. Pretty powerful! </p>\n\n<p>One warning: since this operation modifies both the structure and content of an existing Collection, it&#8217;s probably good to make sure you have some kind of backup available before doing this, in case the results are not exactly what you expected. </p>",
