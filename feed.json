						"title": "Introduction",
						"content_html": "<p>What do we mean by <em>adventure</em>? </p>\n\n<p>My copy of the <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em> offers this definition: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><em>adventure</em>: daring and exciting activity calling for enterprise and enthusiasm </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I started my career in software development by answering a classified ad in the Sunday <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, taking an aptitute test provided by IBM, learning the job of computer operator, teaching myself COBOL from a few training books lying around the computer room,  then writing a couple of useful programs. </p>\n\n<p>When I responded to the ad and showed up in Century City for my interview, I was armed with a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in English and a handgun. (Actually I left the gun in the glovebox of my car; out of desperation, I had just started a job as a security guard, and an insurance company required me to carry a gun while manning my post.) </p>\n\n<p>If this isn&#8217;t yet sounding like an adventure to you, then your understanding of the term must be different from mine! </p>\n\n<p>Some of my favorite books growing up were from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Swift\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tom Swift</a> series, so it&#8217;s always been natural for me to associate invention with adventure. </p>\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to count almost all of the software development I&#8217;ve done over the course of my career as invention; that is, I was often in the enviable position to be able to make stuff up and then see how it worked. </p>\n\n<p>But after a couple of decades of professional software development, my degree in English was still hankering to be put to good use, so when HTML and the World Wide Web came along, I decided to do a bit of writing and then self-publish on the Web. I had no idea whether anyone would actually read any of my stuff, but <a href=\"https://www.reasontorock.com/closing/feedback.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a few people seemed to like it pretty well</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Another adventure! </p>\n\n<p>Almost from the beginning of my web writing, though, I began to design and code software that could help structure and publish an entire web site. </p>\n\n<p>This work evolved into what is now known as Notenik, and I still use it for website construction. </p>\n\n<p>But rather than develop an app that was purely a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">static site generator</a>, I opted to create a general-purpose tool that could additionally be used to do any or all of the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep a simple collection of notes; </li>\n<li>Maintain a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personal wiki</a>; </li>\n<li>Maintain a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personal knowledge base</a>; </li>\n<li>Outline a set of thoughts and ideas, with the option of fleshing these out in place, eventually creating a longer, well-structured work; </li>\n<li>Maintain and organizing a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/personaltech/make-digital-commonplace-book.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital commonplace book</a>, containing ideas and quotations from others; </li>\n<li>Store info in a custom set of fields, uniquely tailored for each different collection of notes; </li>\n<li>Allow users to write using <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Markdown</a>, and then convert to HTML as needed; </li>\n<li>Import. export, sort, filter and format almost any type of personal information, for almost any purpose. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So exploring these many possiblities has been an adventure of its own, and one that is still ongoing! </p>\n\n<p>But Notenik is also intended to foster a sense of adventure <em>for its users</em>. Because it&#8217;s such a flexible tool, with such an extensive (and still evolving) set of features, Notenik users also get to be inventors, first imagining what they might want to do with Notenik, and then assembling the relevant pieces in order to turn their dreams into reality.   </p>\n\n<p>So my intent for <em>Adventures with Notenik</em> is to create a blog containing writings from myself and others, each one describing a particular little adventure with the software, focusing on the &#8220;enterprise and enthusiasm&#8221; going into each effort. </p>\n\n<p>I envision these posts as being inspiring and suggestive, but not necessarily being comprehensive &#8220;how-to&#8221; pieces (although occasional links to relevant sections of the <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-knowledge-base.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Knowledge Base</a> will no doubt be helpful). </p>\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s our first post for the blog. </p>\n\n<p>I look forward to writing more, and also to see what others come up with! </p>\n\n<p>(BTW, <em>Adventures with Notenik</em> now replaces both the <em>News</em> and <em>Usage</em> sections of the website that were there before, if you&#8217;re keeping track.) </p>",

Also, I only do screencasts for Notenik, so I don&#8217;t do it often enough to ever feel like I know what I&#8217;m doing. </p>\n\n<p>With all of that being said, I finally realized that I had stalled long enough, and it was time to do another one. </p>\n\n<p>At 20 minutes, <em>Notenik 201</em> is twice as long as the first one, so there&#8217;s a bit more substance here than there was in the introductory video. This new video explains all of the different ways you can customize a Notenik collection by tailoring field labels and field types and type configurations, so it should prove useful, and seems a logical next step after the <em>101</em> content. </p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve already had a few users view it and respond favorably, so hopefully, if it&#8217;s a topic of interest to you, you should find it worth watching. </p>\n\n<p>You can find it <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qy0hejViBHI?si=ceZPjBdEOpw2ZozH\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here on YouTube</a>. </p>",

						"content_html": "<p>Notenik has a powerful ability to apply match-merge logic to an imported data set. </p>\n\n<p>This feature is currently available for tab-delimited, CSV (comma-separated values), and Notenik import formats. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/import-settings.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Import Settings</a> are the keys to making this work for you. </p>\n\n<p>Three questions arise when performing a match-merge. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>What to do with additional fields? In other words, if the import data set has some fields not already present in the primary Collection (the one to be updated with the import data), how should Notenik handle these? And there are two possible answers. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ignore the additional fields. </li>\n<li>Add the additional fields to the primary Collection. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>What to do with additional rows/lines/record/notes? And there are three options here. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add – Add all the rows in the import file to the primary Collection. </li>\n<li>Match and Add – Use the primary Collection&#8217;s definition of key fields (Title, by default) to try to match imported items with existing items: if a match is found, then use the imported data to update the existing Note to match; if no matching key is found, then add the imported item to the Collection. </li>\n<li>Match Only – Use the matching logic and update matching Notes, but discard any additional input items that do not already have a match. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>What to do with data from obtained from <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/lookup.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lookup fields</a> found in a Notenik Collection being imported? And there are two possible answers: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ignore the referenced data </li>\n<li>Consolidate it, by treating the looked up field labels and values as if they were part of the imported collection. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>How might one use this match-merge feature? </p>\n\n<p>I have one Collection I update on a monthly basis with the latest info available from a website. The website offers an option to download data in CSV format, so after downloading the file, I then import it into my Collection. In this case, I don&#8217;t want to add any additional fields, but do want to match and update my existing Notes. After the import, I&#8217;ve got the latest data in my Notenik Collection! </p>\n\n<p>Something else I tried recently was importing my <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/commonplace-with-lookups.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commonplace with Lookups</a> collection of quotations into a new Collection that did not rely on Lookups (making it more portable). In this case I just created a new Collection of <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/basic-notes.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Basic Notes</a>, and then performed the import, asking to add additional fields, to match and add the additional rows, and to consolidate lookups.  This one quick import then magically transformed my basic notes collection into a fully-populated Commonplace book without any dependencies on other Collections referenced via lookup fields. Pretty powerful! </p>\n\n<p>One warning: since this operation modifies both the structure and content of an existing Collection, it&#8217;s probably good to make sure you have some kind of backup available before doing this, in case the results are not exactly what you expected. </p>",

						"content_html": "<p>I 've used Notenik to build several websites. Here are a few examples: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reasontorock.com\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reason to Rock</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://softdevbigideas.com\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Software Development Big Ideas</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://practopian.org\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Practical Utopian</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lexiconofsong.com\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lexicon of Song</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hbowie.net\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">H. Bowie</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s a general workflow for building such sites, with indications of where Notenik can be used. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-identify-types-of-content\">1. Identify Types of Content</h3>\n\n<p>For any website, you will have one or more types of content. For a simple blog, for example, you will have blog posts. Where Notenik excels, though, is in building sites with more complex content types, and with multiple types. But you need to start out by identifying these. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-identify-organizational-schemes\">2. Identify Organizational Schemes</h3>\n\n<p>How will you present your content to site visitors? A blog typically shows the latest post, followed by more recent ones, plus some sort of archive access. Depending on your content type(s), different means of filtering and ordering your content may be appropriate. Figure out what makes the most sense for your site. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-identify-fields-for-each-content-type\">3. Identify Fields for each Content Type</h3>\n\n<p>What information do you want to present? What sorts of data may benefit from separate handling? What fields will you need for filtering and sorting, based on your organizational schemes? </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-figure-out-where-to-store-everything\">4. Figure Out Where to Store Everything</h3>\n\n<p>When building a website, I typically don&#8217;t use the default location of the iCloud Notenik folder, because I end up with many different folders that I need to access in a variety of ways. The Sites folder within your home folder (as a peer to your Documents folder) is the traditional location for website stuff. If it doesn&#8217;t already exist, then create it, and then create a subfolder for your site, and everything related to it. Then create a <code>content</code> folder. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-build-your-notenik-collections\">5. Build Your Notenik Collections</h3>\n\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to build the Notenik Collections that will house your content. Typically you would want a separate Collection for each content type although, in some cases, it might be beneficial to house them all in one Collection, with a different <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/class.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Class</a> value for each different content type. If in doubt, though, start with a separate Collection for each content type. Place all of these Collections within the <code>content</code> folder you created above. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"6-implement-version-control\">6. Implement Version Control</h3>\n\n<p>I would typically use Git, and use Tower as my Git client. But once you start creating files within your site&#8217;s folder, you probably want to use some sort of version control, and start checking stuff in regularly. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"7-identify-your-web-page-layouts\">7. Identify Your Web Page Layouts</h3>\n\n<p>These would typically include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A page for each content type, showing one Note within that Collection </li>\n<li>One or more index pages listing multiple instances of a particular content type </li>\n<li>A home page for your site, with navigational links leading to the other pages </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Figure out what you want each page to look like. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"8-create-notenik-merge-templates\">8. Create Notenik Merge Templates</h3>\n\n<p>Now create a <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Merge Template</a> for each page layout. These would contain HTML tags, as well as your Merge Commands and Merge Variables. You would create these with your trusty text editor. Typically I would place these in a folder named <code>templates</code>, within a folder named <code>factory</code>, which would be a peer to the <code>content</code> folder you created earlier. It is the templates that specify the names and location of the actual web pages being created. Typically I would put these in a folder called <code>web</code>, that would be a peer to my <code>content</code> and <code>factory</code> folders. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"9-create-and-run-notenik-scripts\">9. Create and Run Notenik Scripts</h3>\n\n<p>Finally create and run your <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/script-files.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Script Files</a>. Your script files pull everything together, reading from your Collections, sorting and filtering those Notes, and then using your templates to generate actual web pages. I would put these into a <code>scripts</code> folder that would be a peer to your <code>templates</code> folder, and also within the <code>factory</code> folder. Your script files will typically contain many steps. I often use Notenik to create the first step, and then go back to my trusty text editor to create others, copying and pasting and tweaking as I go. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"10-test-and-tweak\">10. Test and Tweak</h3>\n\n<p>In this phase you run your scripts and tweak your content and templates until you are happy with the results. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"11-upload-to-a-web-server\">11. Upload to a Web Server</h3>\n\n<p>When everything looks the way you would like, you will want to upload the web pages to your actual site that is resident on an actual web server. I use Transmit as my FTP client, and use A2 Hosting for my web server, but there are many other choices available. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"12-maintain-and-enhance\">12. Maintain and Enhance</h3>\n\n<p>At any point after initial publication, can can add new content to your Collections, and tweak your templates, then rerun your scripts, then upload changes to your web server. Each time you run your scripts your entire site will be rebuilt. However script execution should happen in only a few seconds. </p>",

In this case the merge template file must be named <code>display.html</code> and placed in the same folder as the Notes themselves. For this type of merge template, there should be no <code>output</code> command at all, since the output will be routed by Notenik to its own internal Display tab. </p>\n\n<p>The second type of merge template is used to produce a list or index containing multiple occurrences of Notes. For this type, the <code>output</code> command is typically placed at the very beginning of the template file, and specifies a static output directory and file name. </p>\n\n<p>The third type of merge template is used to produce one output file per input Note. For this type, the <code>output</code> command is placed after the <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/nextrec-command.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nextrec command</a>, and the <code>output</code> file name contains one or more variable fields, so that each Note&#8217;s information will be placed in its own file. </p>\n\n<p>The second and third types are typically both used when creating a website. </p>",

						"title": "Mac Menus",
						"content_html": "<p>Notenik is written in Swift using AppKit (aka Cocoa) which means that in general it has a very traditional Mac user interface. </p>\n\n<p>One of the elements of a traditional Mac app that Notenik is happy to leverage is its menuing system. </p>\n\n<p>Many of Notenik&#8217;s advanced features are available from its main menu, always available at the top of the screen when Notenik is active. </p>\n\n<p>There are two particular features of Mac menus that I want to highlight today. </p>\n\n<p>The first are keyboard shortcuts. You can find a <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/keyboard-shortcuts.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list of these</a> in the Knowledge Base. </p>\n\n<p>Even more conveniently, though, you can see these right alongside, and just to the right, of the menu items to which they provide access.  So for actions that you use often, it&#8217;s good to look for an assigned keyboard shortcut, and then try to memorize it so that you can use it next time, without having to use your pointing device to find and select the item from the top of the screen. </p>\n\n<p>The other handy main menu feature I&#8217;d like to highlight today is the <code>Search</code> box right at the top of the Help menu. If you&#8217;re not sure where to find a particular menu item, you can enter a search word or phrase here, and immediately see a list of menu items containing that search term. Enter additional text to further refine your search. Hover over a line in the search results to see where it can be found in the menu structure, and to see its keyboard shortcut, if there is one. Click on one of those items to select it. </p>\n\n<p>This menu search feature offers another handy way to explore and leverage Notenik&#8217;s extensive main menu structure. </p>\n\n<p>Keyboard shortcuts and menu search &#8211; two helpful macOS functions that are always available within Notenik when you need them. </p>",

						"content_html": "<p>I love the way Notenik manages to evolve gracefully over time. </p>\n\n<p>At some point I added a <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/streamlined-reading.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Streamlined Reading</a> option for a Notenik Collection, which tried to make it easy to read the notes in a collection much as if they were the chapters in a book &#8211; partly by minimizing the display of detailed metadata. </p>\n\n<p>Then later I added a <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/presentation-mode.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Presentation mode</a>, which was also streamlined, but which did not reveal the title of the next note/slide before actually advancing to it. </p>\n\n<p>And then later I added a <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/quotations-mode.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quotations mode</a>, designed to display a collection of quotations in a highly readable fashion. </p>\n\n<p>So at this point I decided to generalize this to a <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/tailor-collection-settings.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Collection Display Mode setting</a>, supporting the selection of any of these modes. </p>\n\n<p>And then I received a request to support an <a href=\"https://discourse.notenik.app/t/optional-display-switch/410?u=hbowie\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optional Display Switch</a>, to allow a user to temporarily switch their display back to normal mode, when using a custom merge template to <a href=\"https://notenik.app/kb/tailor-the-display.html\" class=\"ext-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tailor the display</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And then&#8230; rather than adding yet another display switching mechanism, I simply added a Display mode of <code>Custom</code> that would be automatically set on the detection of a <code>display.html</code> merge template, but which would then allow the user to select the <code>Normal</code> display mode, and then re-select <code>Custom</code> whenever they wanted to return to their custom display. </p>\n\n<p>It gives me great satisfaction to continue to address new enhancement opportunities, and find ways to gracefully integrate them into the code base and into the user experience. </p>",
