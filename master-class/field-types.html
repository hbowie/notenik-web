<p>In order to make fields as useful as possible, Notenik recognizes different <em>types</em> of fields. </p>

<p>Different types of fields will have different editing widgets. </p>

<p>But different types of fields may also be sorted differently. </p>

<p>As an example, Notenik will recognize that, when you sort a date, the year is most important, then the month, and finally the day of the month &#8211; even when the date components are entered in a different sequence, or with alphabetic values for months. </p>

<p>And when you sort a sequence number, Notenik will recognize that 2 should come before 10, even if the &#8216;2&#8217; is entered without a leading zero. </p>

<p>And different types of fields may also be formatted differently, with different formatting options. </p>
