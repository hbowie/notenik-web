<p>Each script is stored in its own file. As many <a href="scripting-operations.html" class="wiki-link">Scripting Operations</a> as desired may be placed within a single file. </p>

<p>The file extension for a Notenik script file should be &#8216;<code>.tcz</code>&#8217;. This is a contraction of &#8216;TDF Czar&#8217;, which was the name of an earlier app whose functions were eventually migrated into the current incarnation of Notenik. </p>

<p>A Notenik script file is a tab-delimited file, also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tab-separated values</a> file. </p>

<p>A Notenik script file contains five columns. </p>

<p>The first row of the file contains column headings, identifying the following columns: </p>
<ol>
<li>module </li>
<li>action </li>
<li>modifier </li>
<li>object </li>
<li>value </li>
</ol>

<p>Each subsequent row contains a blank line, a comment, or an operation to be performed. </p>
