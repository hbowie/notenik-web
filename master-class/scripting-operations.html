<p>A script file works its magic by generally executing the following operations, in the following sequence. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Identify an <strong>input</strong> data source: typically a Notenik Collection, but other options are available as well. </p>

<p>Each new data source typically replaces any others that were previously identified, but a <em>merge</em> option is available to allow combining of multiple sources. </p>

<p>Any data input is now treated as a series of rows arranged into columns, with each Note becoming a separate row, and each Field becoming a separate column. </p></li>
<li><p>Optionally <strong>filter</strong> the data to exclude some of the rows that are not needed for subsequent operations. </p></li>
<li><p>Optionally <strong>sort</strong> the data by one or more columns to get rows into some desired sequence to be used for subsequent operations. </p></li>
<li><p>Process a merge <strong>template</strong>, running the filtered and sorted data through the template, and generating whatever output was specified by the template. </p></li>
<li><p>Optionally generate an <strong>output</strong> file directly, without the use of a merge template. </p></li>
<li><p>Direct your web browser to <strong>browse</strong> a local URL at which you would expect to find your generated website. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This same general series of operations may be repeated as many times as is needed, depending on your goals, your data sources, and your merge templates. </p>

<p>Note that in the Knowledge Base, each of these operations is performed by its own <a href="notenik://help?id=scriptingmodules" class="wiki-link">Scripting Module</a>. </p>
