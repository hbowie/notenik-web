							Changing Adventure URLs
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 23 &bull;  Wednesday, August 14, 2024</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m making a few updates to the <em>Adventures</em> blog. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The blog post URLs are changing. I had previously been prefixing each post with the date of the post, followed by the title. As things evolved, though, I realized I wanted to use wiki links between some of the entries, and the date prefixes made it harder to translate these links from the Notenik collection to the actual website. Also, I realized that, as these posts began to evolve, I really wanted each post to have a unique title anyway. So the dates are gone. And good riddance, I say. But if you&#8217;ve bookmarked any of these, then you&#8217;ll need to update your bookmarks. Sorry for my lack of prescience on this issue. </p></li>
<li><p>On the Notenik Discourse forum, @ThePrinter made the <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/outlining-with-notenik/530/2?u=hbowie" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent suggestion</a> of modifying the HTML title of each post to place the title of the post before the name of the blog, to make it easier to distinguish between tabs, when viewing more than one. This too has been implemented. </p></li>
<li><p>I had previously been offering two different versions of the blog page, one with full posts, and one only with summaries of each post. But the wiki links between posts also proved problematic when showing a page of full posts, so I&#8217;ve eliminated this version. (I&#8217;d grown to prefer the summaries page anyway; hopefully others feel the same.) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully none of these changes will prove too disruptive for anyone, and together I hope they will smooth the path to continued useful evolution of these <em>Adventures</em>. </p>

							Automatically Incrementing Sequence Numbers

					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 22 &bull;  Tuesday, August 13, 2024</p>

					<p>This post is part of an evolving series that can somewhat usefully be read in order. </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="outlining-with-notenik.html" class="wiki-link">Outlining with Notenik</a> </li>
<li>Automatically Incrementing Sequence Numbers (this post) </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>Upon first consideration, having to manually wrangle sequence and level numbers in order to create an outline might seem unnecessarily difficult. </p>

<p>And so it would be, were it not for a number of convenient features that Notenik supplies specifically for working with outlines. </p>

<p>The first group of these helps by automatically incrementing sequence numbers. </p>

<p>This can work in three somewhat distinct ways. </p>

<p>First, if you position the current Note selection (using any of the views on the left of the Collection Window), and then request the addition of a New Note (which can be done most readily with the keyboard shortcut of CMD-N), you will see that your Seq value has been automatically incremented for you, and the Level value set to match the preceding Note — the one you initially selected. And so you can easily continue adding Notes to an outline without having to worry about Seq and Level numbers. Nifty! </p>

<p>Second, if you instead use the <code>New Note w/Options</code> item (just beneath the <code>New Note</code> item described above, towards the top of the <code>Note</code> menu, and easily accessible with a keyboard shortcut of OPT-CMD-N), you will see a little window allowing you to enter several fields at once. You can enter the Title of the Note, along with the Level and Seq fields. But here you will also see <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> keys that can be used to increment/decrement the Level value and — as you do so — the Seq field will be automatically adjusted to fit into the appropriate numbering sequence for the chosen Level! This can be super handy when you are adding Notes in sequence, but they are not all at the same level of indention. Click <code>OK</code> when you are done, and then your values will be pre-populated on the Edit tab for you. </p>

<p>And then, third, as a minor variation of the second option, if you click on the <code>Again</code> button instead of the <code>OK</code> button, you can skip the Edit tab, have Notenik add the Note for you —with just the fields you have entered in the <code>New Note with Options</code> window — and then immediately return to the <code>New Note with Options</code> window to add the next Note. This can be especially handy when you are trying to quickly capture the bare bones of an outline, with just Title fields and positions, leaving the possibility of fleshing out additional details later. </p>

<p>So there you have it! Three ways to have Notenik automatically increment your Seq values, without you having to manually enter any value other than the first! </p>

					<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned previously, Notenik supports <a href="lets-talk-metadata.html" class="wiki-link">metadata</a>. And different sorts of fields can be used for different purposes. </p>

<p>In many cases, you will want to sort the Notes in a Collection by some <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/field-labels-and-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">field</a> that contains data about the Note — something like Title or Author or Date, let&#8217;s say. </p>

<p>In other cases, though, you will want to impose some organizational sequence on a Collection of Notes based on the relationship between the Notes, or on some logical sequence that is not apparent from any of the metadata about the Note. </p>

<p>This is when you would want to use the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/seq.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seq</a> field. </p>

<p>A Seq field contains artificial values — values that you assign simply to get your Notes into whatever sequence is meaningful to you. </p>

<p>As you&#8217;re assigning such values, you will want to change the Sort sequences for your Collection to <code>Seq + Title</code>, or some other sort sequence making use of the Seq field, so you can see your Notes in the sequence you have assigned to them. </p>

<p>And then, to refine this approach a bit more, you can use the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/level.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Level</a> field to organize some Notes as being subordinate to others. </p>

<p>By combining these two fields — Seq and Level — you can structure your Notes into a hierarchy usually referred to as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outline</a>. </p>

<p>When fashioning an outline, you will generally want your Seq values to reflect your outline structure. That is, you will want your top level Notes to be numbered consecutively and then, within each parent item, you will want your children numbered consecutively, with a period (aka <em>dot</em> or <em>full stop</em>) separating each parent number from the numbering of its children. This numbering can be done recursively, to as many levels as you would like. </p>

<p>You&#8217;ll note that the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-knowledge-base.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik Knowledge Base</a> is structured in this fashion, using an outline. The Knowledge Base is one of several Notenik Collections stored within the <code>NotenikDocs</code> repo on GitHub. You can always download the repo from <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/NotenikDocs" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> if you&#8217;d like to inspect a working example of such an outline. </p>

<p>As it happens, Notenik seems to support Seq numbering in conformance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_2145" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISO 2145</a>. </p>

<p>Oh and by the way, feel free to use upper- or lower-case letters [a..z] instead of numbers, if you would like. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll share more Notenik outlining tips in future Adventures, but this should be enough to whet your appetite. </p>

							Formatting a Quote Attribution with Notenik 15.0.0
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 20 &bull;  Sunday, August 4, 2024</p>

					<p>The basic <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">syntax of Markdown</a> is easy to learn and invariant across many parsers &#8211; which explains the popularity of this writing tool in a nutshell. </p>

<p>At the same time, many people have created <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extensions</a> to the original tool as a means of solving many common problems, and many of these extensions have also been implemented consistently across a number of popular parsers. </p>

<p>And, of course, Notenik implements almost all of this. </p>

<p>But Notenik version 15.0.0 has just been released and, in addition to fixing a few bugs, this new release adds a new Markdown extension to solve a recurring problem that still seems to be outstanding. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the problem. </p>

<p>HTML offers the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockquote</a> tag to allow a quotation to be distinguished from surrounding text, and this tag can be easily styled with CSS. </p>

<p>And standard Markdown implements a <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handy convention for generating blockquotes</a>, so all is well here. </p>

<p>The problem arises when an author wants to provide a nicely formatted attribution line following the quotation, indicating its source. </p>

<p>Because here there is no special HTML tag nor any Markdown syntax to provide any help. </p>

<p>Nor is there any overall consensus on the best way to format such a commonly seen line, even when dropping down out of Markdown into HTML. </p>

<p>I like to include quotations in my writing on a regular basis, so I&#8217;ve been working aound this issue for some time now. </p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve finally created a new Markdown extension to help address this problem. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the simplest form of such an attribution: </p>

<pre><code>{:quote-from:George Bernard Shaw}
</code></pre>

<p>And here&#8217;s the way it would look, when expanded by Notenik, following the appropriate quotation. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You see things; and you say, &#8216;Why?&#8217; But I dream things that never were; and I say, &#8216;Why not?&#8217; </p>
</blockquote>

<p class="quote-from"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Bernard Shaw</a>, 1921, from the play <cite>Back to Methuselah</cite></p>

<p>Note that, in this case, I&#8217;ve included other information, in addition to the author&#8217;s name, so that the full Markdown would look like this: </p>

<pre><code>{:quote-from:George Bernard Shaw|1921|Play|Back to Methuselah|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw|}
</code></pre>

<p>All the details can be found in the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/format-a-quote-citation.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowledge Base</a>. </p>

<p>Notenik also provides some default CSS styling for both the <code>blockquote</code> tag, and for the <code>quote-from</code> class that is applied to the paragraph element enclosing the citation text, to make everything line up nicely, and to provide the leading em dash. But of course this can be overridden by the user for their particular application. </p>

<p>I hope others make use of this as much as I know I will! </p>

					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 19 &bull;  Tuesday, July 30, 2024</p>

					<p>Once you have a commonplace book, what can you do with it? </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where all that hard work pays off, if you&#8217;re using Notenik. </p>
<ul>
<li>View all the entries in your book, sorted by the titles you have assigned to each entry. </li>
<li>View the entries sorted by <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/author.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Author</a>. </li>
<li>View the entries sorted by <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/date-added.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Date Added</a>, or by <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/timestamp.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timestamp</a>. </li>
<li>View your book as a tree, organized by category (aka <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tags.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tags</a>), so that you can see the entries you&#8217;ve placed in a certain category. </li>
<li><a href="https://notenik.app/kb/share-with-options.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Share</a> any particular entry as a nicely formatted quotation, in either Markdown or HTML; share to the clipboard in preparation for pasting into another app or text file or web page. </li>
<li>View a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/custom-url-scheme.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">random</a> quotation. </li>
<li>Publish to a <a href="https://hbowie.net/authors/index.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web site</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://notenik.app/kb/import-and-export-your-notes.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Export</a> into another format. </li>
</ul>

<p>And I&#8217;m sure there are probably some others that I&#8217;m forgetting, but these are the ones I use the most. </p>

							Commonplace Data

					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 18 &bull;  Monday, July 29, 2024</p>

					<p>Once you&#8217;ve <a href="https://notenik.app/adventures/2024-07-27-commonplacing-with-notenik.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed to starting a commonplace book</a>, and then decided to store your book in <a href="https://notenik.app/adventures/2024-07-28-storage-medium-for-a-commonplace-book.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plain text files formatted with Markdown</a>, then the next question is: what data do you want to collect as part of each entry? </p>

<p>Many sites only provide a quotation along with an author. But then, many sites seem to make things up, or repeat things that have been heard elsewhere, even if they <a href="https://www.snopes.com/collections/albert-einstein-collection/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have no basis in fact</a>. </p>

<p>So I generally like to capture the year in which the quotation was first published or recorded, along with its original source. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikiquote</a> is often a good source for this information. But of course, if you&#8217;re capturing an entry as part of your own reading of a source, that additional data is already readily available. </p>

<p>And then, of course, you can try to categorize each entry as it is made. I&#8217;ve found this to be a very useful exercise, partially because it helps me to think more deeply about the import of each quotation. In Notenik, the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tags.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tags</a> field can be used for this purpose. Notenik allows multiple tags to be assigned to each entry, and also supports nested tags. You probably don&#8217;t want to go overboard with tagging, but I would certainly recommend some level as a way to make your growing collection both more interesting and more useful. </p>

<p>One additional consideration is whether you want your commonplace to be stored in a single collection, or in a series of related collections. For example, Notenik allows the user to create a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/commonplace-with-lookups.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commonplace with Lookups</a>, in which both Authors and their Works are stored in separate collections. The advantage of this sort of setup — especially if you want to collect additional info about authors, and about their works — is that such data then only needs to be entered once, and can then simply be referenced if you have multiple entries from the same author,  and/or from the same work. </p>

<p>Notenik offers a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/fields-useful-for-reviews-citations-and-quotations.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of different field types</a> that can be used as part of a commonplace book, whether you use lookups <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/commonplace-book.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or not</a>. </p>

<p>But then, what can you do with this additional data, once you start collecting it? Well, that will be the subject of our next post. </p>

					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 17 &bull;  Sunday, July 28, 2024</p>

					<p>Once you&#8217;ve committed to starting a commonplace book, your first question will be: how should I store it? </p>

<p>Upon first consideration, this may seem like an easy answer, since there are all sorts of available document formats and apps available that will hold words for you. </p>

<p>But consider that this is a collection of words that you may well want to continue growing for not just months, or years, but for decades — without ever having to lose everything and start over. </p>

<p>So you don&#8217;t want to store it using some sort of service or app that might suddenly go out of business, or decide to terminate the particular offering you are using. </p>

<p>You probably don&#8217;t want to use some format that will require a subscription that has to be paid regularly in order for you to continue to have access to your commonplace book. </p>

<p>And you probably don&#8217;t want to trust your collection to some esoteric data format that is not well supported by a number of different apps. </p>

<p>You do want a format that can be easily backed up. </p>

<p>You do want to be able to preserve the original formatting of each entry, along with any associated data that may be important to you (more on that later). </p>

<p>And, ideally, you want each individual entry to be separately addressable, so that it&#8217;s easily available for later reference and use, and so that your commonplace collection can be easily categorized, sorted and filtered in different ways. </p>

<p>And you want to be able to easily extract and make use of individual entries, and integrate them into other works, which may be in a variety of formats. </p>

<p>Once you take all of these points into consideration, I think the only rational way to store your commonplace book is: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plain text</a>, with the quotes formatted using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown</a>; </p></li>
<li><p>With each entry stored in its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text file</a>. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>And, of course, this is exactly how Notenik will store your commonplace book. </p>

							Commonplacing with Notenik
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 16 &bull;  Saturday, July 27, 2024</p>

					<p>As one reviewer on the US Mac App Store says, Notenik &#8220;is flexible enough to fit any number of use cases, from the simple to the complex.&#8221; </p>

<p>But certainly one of my core use cases for Notenik is storage of a commonplace book. </p>

<p>You can read more about commonplace books on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> but, if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the term, it can be most readily described as a collection of sayings or excerpts, maintained by an individual, with the items often collected under thematic headings. </p>

<p>And the NY Times has a nice &#8220;tech tip&#8221; from a couple of years ago talking about how to &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/personaltech/make-digital-commonplace-book.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a Digital Commonplace Book</a>.&#8221; </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping one for decades now &#8211; long before I became acquainted with the term &#8220;commonplace,&#8221; used in this way. And I had an older Mac App, written in Java, called <a href="https://macdownload.informer.com/iwisdom/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iWisdom</a>, that was designed specifically for this purpose. </p>

<p>Based on my own experience, my recommendation is for everyone to start and continue to maintain their own commonplace book, for all of the following reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>It encourages one to read — the most important way of expanding one&#8217;s knowledge and perspectives. </p></li>
<li><p>It makes one a more active and engaged reader. </p></li>
<li><p>It forces one to be selective, since the act of transcribing a quotation from its original source takes some time and effort, and is not worth doing for every bit of text one runs across. In other words, it encourages us to separate the wheat from the chaff. </p></li>
<li><p>The result is a continually growing record of what one has read, and a resource of words that have had some particular meaning for us. </p></li>
<li><p>The ability to refer back to such a collection has enduring value for thinkers and writers interested in organizing and distilling important ideas, and synthesizing new ones. </p></li>
<li><p>For all of us, as we mature, such a collection can serve as an important reminder of the words that have had meaning for us over the years, and an opportunity to reflect on the significance of these thoughts in our own lives. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;ll have more to say about &#8220;commonplacing with Notenik&#8221; in several follow-on posts, but this one will hopefully serve as an introduction to the series. </p>

					<p>I&#8217;ll tell you a little secret &#8211; even if no one else in the world was using Notenik, I would still continue to work on it, just because I want to use it. </p>

<p>If there were another Mac app out there that worked the way Notenik did, and did all the same things that Notenik does, then I would probably stop working on my little app, and switch to the other product. </p>

<p>But, to the best of my knowledge, there&#8217;s nothing else out there with quite the right combination of quirks and features to scratch my particular itch. </p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, though &#8211; it provides me with great satisfaction to develop software that others can use, and to see others discovering it and using it, and appreciating it for the same reasons I do &#8211; and even pointing out ways to make it better. </p>

							Let's Talk Metadata
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 14 &bull;  Thursday, July 18, 2024</p>

					<p>Let&#8217;s talk metadata for a minute. </p>

<p>In the beginning there was HTML. </p>

<p>And HTML begat Markdown. </p>

<p>And Markdown begat MultiMarkdown. </p>

<p>And MultiMarkdown made explicit provision for <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/blob/master/Documentation/MultiMarkdown%20User%27s%20Guide.md#metadata" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metadata</a>: additional fields carrying information about a Markdown document. </p>

<p>And then <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YAML front matter</a> came along, which was another way of specifying metadata for a Markdown document. </p>

<p>But Notenik has been supporting Markdown metadata for at least ten years, going back to the original version, written in Java. </p>

<p>In Notenik, we just call them <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/field-labels-and-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fields</a>. </p>

<p>All of these formats &#8211; MultiMarkdown, YAML front matter, and Notenik &#8211; are slightly different, and Notenik supports all three. But basically these are just three different, but very similar, ways of supporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name–value_pair" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">name-value pairs</a> within text files that also contain Markdown. </p>

<p>But there is a difference between Notenik&#8217;s use of metadata vs. the way this info is used in other apps. </p>

<p>In all cases, metadata supplies variables that can be used when formatting a Markdown document. </p>

<p>But with Notenik: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Each different collection of text files, stored in its own folder,  can have its own specific definition of the types and names of fields to be found within that collection; </p></li>
<li><p>The metadata is used, not just to format and identify documents, but as a means of <em>organizing</em> the files within a collection, so that the collection itself becomes an entity with its own characteristics. Add a date field, and then you can sort by date. Add an author field, and you can sort by author. Add a status field, and you can separate completed items from ones still in work. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Metadata is the basis of many of Notenik&#8217;s most powerful functions, so it&#8217;s good to get a handle on what it is and how it can be used. </p>

							Custom Display Mode
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 13 &bull;  Wednesday, July 17, 2024</p>

					<p>I love the way Notenik manages to evolve gracefully over time. </p>

<p>At some point I added a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/streamlined-reading.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streamlined Reading</a> option for a Notenik Collection, which tried to make it easy to read the notes in a collection much as if they were the chapters in a book &#8211; partly by minimizing the display of detailed metadata. </p>

<p>Then later I added a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/presentation-mode.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Presentation mode</a>, which was also streamlined, but which did not reveal the title of the next note/slide before actually advancing to it. </p>

<p>And then later I added a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/quotations-mode.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quotations mode</a>, designed to display a collection of quotations in a highly readable fashion. </p>

<p>So at this point I decided to generalize this to a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tailor-collection-settings.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collection Display Mode setting</a>, supporting the selection of any of these modes. </p>

<p>And then I received a request to support an <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/optional-display-switch/410?u=hbowie" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optional Display Switch</a>, to allow a user to temporarily switch their display back to normal mode, when using a custom merge template to <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tailor-the-display.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tailor the display</a>. </p>

<p>And then&#8230; rather than adding yet another display switching mechanism, I simply added a Display mode of <code>Custom</code> that would be automatically set on the detection of a <code>display.html</code> merge template, but which would then allow the user to select the <code>Normal</code> display mode, and then re-select <code>Custom</code> whenever they wanted to return to their custom display. </p>

<p>It gives me great satisfaction to continue to address new enhancement opportunities, and find ways to gracefully integrate them into the code base and into the user experience. </p>

							Mac Menus
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 12 &bull;  Tuesday, July 16, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik is written in Swift using AppKit (aka Cocoa) which means that in general it has a very traditional Mac user interface. </p>

<p>One of the elements of a traditional Mac app that Notenik is happy to leverage is its menuing system. </p>

<p>Many of Notenik&#8217;s advanced features are available from its main menu, always available at the top of the screen when Notenik is active. </p>

<p>There are two particular features of Mac menus that I want to highlight today. </p>

<p>The first are keyboard shortcuts. You can find a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/keyboard-shortcuts.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of these</a> in the Knowledge Base. </p>

<p>Even more conveniently, though, you can see these right alongside, and just to the right, of the menu items to which they provide access.  So for actions that you use often, it&#8217;s good to look for an assigned keyboard shortcut, and then try to memorize it so that you can use it next time, without having to use your pointing device to find and select the item from the top of the screen. </p>

<p>The other handy main menu feature I&#8217;d like to highlight today is the <code>Search</code> box right at the top of the Help menu. If you&#8217;re not sure where to find a particular menu item, you can enter a search word or phrase here, and immediately see a list of menu items containing that search term. Enter additional text to further refine your search. Hover over a line in the search results to see where it can be found in the menu structure, and to see its keyboard shortcut, if there is one. Click on one of those items to select it. </p>

<p>This menu search feature offers another handy way to explore and leverage Notenik&#8217;s extensive main menu structure. </p>

<p>Keyboard shortcuts and menu search &#8211; two helpful macOS functions that are always available within Notenik when you need them. </p>

							Three Types of Merge Templates
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 11 &bull;  Monday, July 15, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik supports essentially three different types of <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merge Templates</a>. </p>

<p>And these three types are distinguished by the varying placements of the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/output-command.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output command</a>. </p>

<p>The first type is used to <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tailor-the-display.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tailor the display</a> of notes within Notenik itself, as they appear on the Display tab. In this case the merge template file must be named <code>display.html</code> and placed in the same folder as the Notes themselves. For this type of merge template, there should be no <code>output</code> command at all, since the output will be routed by Notenik to its own internal Display tab. </p>

<p>The second type of merge template is used to produce a list or index containing multiple occurrences of Notes. For this type, the <code>output</code> command is typically placed at the very beginning of the template file, and specifies a static output directory and file name. </p>

<p>The third type of merge template is used to produce one output file per input Note. For this type, the <code>output</code> command is placed after the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/nextrec-command.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nextrec command</a>, and the <code>output</code> file name contains one or more variable fields, so that each Note&#8217;s information will be placed in its own file. </p>

<p>The second and third types are typically both used when creating a website. </p>

							Use Merge Templates to Format Output
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 10 &bull;  Friday, July 12, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik uses <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merge Templates</a> to generate output text files (such as web pages using HTML and web feeds using RSS or JSON). </p>

<p>They are called Merge Templates because they merge field values from Note(s)s into some sort of structure provided by a template. </p>

<p>Each Merge Template contains essentially three sorts of things: </p>
<ul>
<li>Output Structure – This depends entirely on what the output is to be used for. </li>
<li>Field Labels – Drawing on fields available from the input. </li>
<li>Merge Commands &#8211; These provide guidance on how the input data should be processed. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the template can specify one or more modifiers to be applied to each field value, in order to ensure the data is formatted appropriately. </p>

<p>Merge Templates are one of Notenik&#8217;s most powerful features, because they allow you to easily format the data in your Notes into any output format that can be expressed within a text file.  HTML, XML, JSON, CSV, tab-delimited and plain text files can all be generated easily, whenever you like. </p>

					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 9 &bull;  Thursday, July 11, 2024</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s taken a few tries to get this working but from now on I believe all of the <em>Adventures with Notenik</em> blog posts (starting with this one!) should be automatically cross-posting to @notenik@mastodon.social. </p>

<p>So now, in addition to being able to keep up with the blog by subscribing to one of its web feeds, you can now follow <a href="https://mastodon.social/@notenik" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@notenik@mastodon.social</a> to see the daily posts. </p>

<p>Since Mastodon is a micro-blogging service, the full content of each post will not appear there, but only the title and the teaser, with a link back to the full post on <a href="https://notenik.app/adventure-summaries.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik.app</a>. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="https://ifttt.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFTTT</a> to do the cross-posting, following the approach outlined <a href="https://hyperborea.org/journal/2017/12/mastodon-ifttt/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

							How To Build A Website
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 8 &bull;  Wednesday, July 10, 2024</p>

					<p>I 've used Notenik to build several websites. Here are a few examples: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reasontorock.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reason to Rock</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://softdevbigideas.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Software Development Big Ideas</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://practopian.org" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Practical Utopian</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://lexiconofsong.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lexicon of Song</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://hbowie.net" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H. Bowie</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>And here&#8217;s a general workflow for building such sites, with indications of where Notenik can be used. </p>

<h3 id="1-identify-types-of-content">1. Identify Types of Content</h3>

<p>For any website, you will have one or more types of content. For a simple blog, for example, you will have blog posts. Where Notenik excels, though, is in building sites with more complex content types, and with multiple types. But you need to start out by identifying these. </p>

<h3 id="2-identify-organizational-schemes">2. Identify Organizational Schemes</h3>

<p>How will you present your content to site visitors? A blog typically shows the latest post, followed by more recent ones, plus some sort of archive access. Depending on your content type(s), different means of filtering and ordering your content may be appropriate. Figure out what makes the most sense for your site. </p>

<h3 id="3-identify-fields-for-each-content-type">3. Identify Fields for each Content Type</h3>

<p>What information do you want to present? What sorts of data may benefit from separate handling? What fields will you need for filtering and sorting, based on your organizational schemes? </p>

<h3 id="4-figure-out-where-to-store-everything">4. Figure Out Where to Store Everything</h3>

<p>When building a website, I typically don&#8217;t use the default location of the iCloud Notenik folder, because I end up with many different folders that I need to access in a variety of ways. The Sites folder within your home folder (as a peer to your Documents folder) is the traditional location for website stuff. If it doesn&#8217;t already exist, then create it, and then create a subfolder for your site, and everything related to it. Then create a <code>content</code> folder. </p>

<h3 id="5-build-your-notenik-collections">5. Build Your Notenik Collections</h3>

<p>Now it&#8217;s time to build the Notenik Collections that will house your content. Typically you would want a separate Collection for each content type although, in some cases, it might be beneficial to house them all in one Collection, with a different <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/class.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Class</a> value for each different content type. If in doubt, though, start with a separate Collection for each content type. Place all of these Collections within the <code>content</code> folder you created above. </p>

<h3 id="6-implement-version-control">6. Implement Version Control</h3>

<p>I would typically use Git, and use Tower as my Git client. But once you start creating files within your site&#8217;s folder, you probably want to use some sort of version control, and start checking stuff in regularly. </p>

<h3 id="7-identify-your-web-page-layouts">7. Identify Your Web Page Layouts</h3>

<p>These would typically include: </p>
<ul>
<li>A page for each content type, showing one Note within that Collection </li>
<li>One or more index pages listing multiple instances of a particular content type </li>
<li>A home page for your site, with navigational links leading to the other pages </li>
</ul>

<p>Figure out what you want each page to look like. </p>

<h3 id="8-create-notenik-merge-templates">8. Create Notenik Merge Templates</h3>

<p>Now create a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merge Template</a> for each page layout. These would contain HTML tags, as well as your Merge Commands and Merge Variables. You would create these with your trusty text editor. Typically I would place these in a folder named <code>templates</code>, within a folder named <code>factory</code>, which would be a peer to the <code>content</code> folder you created earlier. It is the templates that specify the names and location of the actual web pages being created. Typically I would put these in a folder called <code>web</code>, that would be a peer to my <code>content</code> and <code>factory</code> folders. </p>

<h3 id="9-create-and-run-notenik-scripts">9. Create and Run Notenik Scripts</h3>

<p>Finally create and run your <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/script-files.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Script Files</a>. Your script files pull everything together, reading from your Collections, sorting and filtering those Notes, and then using your templates to generate actual web pages. I would put these into a <code>scripts</code> folder that would be a peer to your <code>templates</code> folder, and also within the <code>factory</code> folder. Your script files will typically contain many steps. I often use Notenik to create the first step, and then go back to my trusty text editor to create others, copying and pasting and tweaking as I go. </p>

<h3 id="10-test-and-tweak">10. Test and Tweak</h3>

<p>In this phase you run your scripts and tweak your content and templates until you are happy with the results. </p>

<h3 id="11-upload-to-a-web-server">11. Upload to a Web Server</h3>

<p>When everything looks the way you would like, you will want to upload the web pages to your actual site that is resident on an actual web server. I use Transmit as my FTP client, and use A2 Hosting for my web server, but there are many other choices available. </p>

<h3 id="12-maintain-and-enhance">12. Maintain and Enhance</h3>

<p>At any point after initial publication, can can add new content to your Collections, and tweak your templates, then rerun your scripts, then upload changes to your web server. Each time you run your scripts your entire site will be rebuilt. However script execution should happen in only a few seconds. </p>

						<a class="invisi-link" href="adventures/using-match-merge-logic-in-notenik.html"?>
							Using Match-Merge Logic in Notenik
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 7 &bull;  Tuesday, July 9, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik has a powerful ability to apply match-merge logic to an imported data set. </p>

<p>This feature is currently available for tab-delimited, CSV (comma-separated values), and Notenik import formats. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/import-settings.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Import Settings</a> are the keys to making this work for you. </p>

<p>Three questions arise when performing a match-merge. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>What to do with additional fields? In other words, if the import data set has some fields not already present in the primary Collection (the one to be updated with the import data), how should Notenik handle these? And there are two possible answers. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore the additional fields. </li>
<li>Add the additional fields to the primary Collection. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What to do with additional rows/lines/record/notes? And there are three options here. </p>
<ul>
<li>Add – Add all the rows in the import file to the primary Collection. </li>
<li>Match and Add – Use the primary Collection&#8217;s definition of key fields (Title, by default) to try to match imported items with existing items: if a match is found, then use the imported data to update the existing Note to match; if no matching key is found, then add the imported item to the Collection. </li>
<li>Match Only – Use the matching logic and update matching Notes, but discard any additional input items that do not already have a match. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What to do with data from obtained from <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/lookup.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lookup fields</a> found in a Notenik Collection being imported? And there are two possible answers: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore the referenced data </li>
<li>Consolidate it, by treating the looked up field labels and values as if they were part of the imported collection. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>How might one use this match-merge feature? </p>

<p>I have one Collection I update on a monthly basis with the latest info available from a website. The website offers an option to download data in CSV format, so after downloading the file, I then import it into my Collection. In this case, I don&#8217;t want to add any additional fields, but do want to match and update my existing Notes. After the import, I&#8217;ve got the latest data in my Notenik Collection! </p>

<p>Something else I tried recently was importing my <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/commonplace-with-lookups.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commonplace with Lookups</a> collection of quotations into a new Collection that did not rely on Lookups (making it more portable). In this case I just created a new Collection of <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/basic-notes.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basic Notes</a>, and then performed the import, asking to add additional fields, to match and add the additional rows, and to consolidate lookups.  This one quick import then magically transformed my basic notes collection into a fully-populated Commonplace book without any dependencies on other Collections referenced via lookup fields. Pretty powerful! </p>

<p>One warning: since this operation modifies both the structure and content of an existing Collection, it&#8217;s probably good to make sure you have some kind of backup available before doing this, in case the results are not exactly what you expected. </p>

							Notenik 201 Video Now Available
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 6 &bull;  Monday, July 8, 2024</p>

					<p>My first Notenik video, which I called <em>Notenik 101</em>, has been out for a couple of years now. Some people seemed to find it useful, but it was a fair amount of work and, to be honest, not my favorite kind of labor. Also, I only do screencasts for Notenik, so I don&#8217;t do it often enough to ever feel like I know what I&#8217;m doing. </p>

<p>With all of that being said, I finally realized that I had stalled long enough, and it was time to do another one. </p>

<p>At 20 minutes, <em>Notenik 201</em> is twice as long as the first one, so there&#8217;s a bit more substance here than there was in the introductory video. This new video explains all of the different ways you can customize a Notenik collection by tailoring field labels and field types and type configurations, so it should prove useful, and seems a logical next step after the <em>101</em> content. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already had a few users view it and respond favorably, so hopefully, if it&#8217;s a topic of interest to you, you should find it worth watching. </p>

<p>You can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/Qy0hejViBHI?si=ceZPjBdEOpw2ZozH" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on YouTube</a>. </p>

							Adding a Web Feed to Your Site
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 2 &bull;  Thursday, July 4, 2024</p>

					<p>If you have a website to which you regularly add content, then at some point you will probably want to add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web feed</a> to your site. </p>

<p>You can use a combination of Notenik&#8217;s <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/script-files.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Script files</a> and <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merge templates</a> to easily generate such web feeds, in any or all of the major formats. </p>

<p>Such feeds will typically have one entry for each recent post, starting with the latest, and then proceeding backwards. </p>

<p>You don&#8217;t want to include all your site&#8217;s content in your feed, though, going back to the beginning of time. </p>

<p>So typically you pick some reasonable number and cut off your feed generation once you reach that point. </p>

<p>Exactly what constitutes a reasonable number may vary somewhat depending on the nature of your site, and how often it is updated. </p>

<p>In general, though, 20 seems like a good place to start. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s always been possible to do this sort of counting with Notenik, but a new feature in <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-14.8.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Version 14.8.0</a> makes this even easier and more straightforward. </p>

<p>Now you can simply add a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/filter-module-parameters.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filter rule</a> that compares the new system variable <code>datacount</code> to the maximum number you have chosen. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what this would look like in your script file (with tabs separating the columns): </p>

<pre><code>filter	add	le	datacount	20
</code></pre>

							Introduction
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 1 &bull;  Wednesday, July 3, 2024</p>

					<p>What do we mean by <em>adventure</em>? </p>

<p>My copy of the <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em> offers this definition: </p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>adventure</em>: daring and exciting activity calling for enterprise and enthusiasm </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started my career in software development by answering a classified ad in the Sunday <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, taking an aptitute test provided by IBM, learning the job of computer operator, teaching myself COBOL from a few training books lying around the computer room,  then writing a couple of useful programs. </p>

<p>When I responded to the ad and showed up in Century City for my interview, I was armed with a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in English and a handgun. (Actually I left the gun in the glovebox of my car; out of desperation, I had just started a job as a security guard, and an insurance company required me to carry a gun while manning my post.) </p>

<p>If this isn&#8217;t yet sounding like an adventure to you, then your understanding of the term must be different from mine! </p>

<p>Some of my favorite books growing up were from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Swift" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Swift</a> series, so it&#8217;s always been natural for me to associate invention with adventure. </p>

<p>And I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to count almost all of the software development I&#8217;ve done over the course of my career as invention; that is, I was often in the enviable position to be able to make stuff up and then see how it worked. </p>

<p>But after a couple of decades of professional software development, my degree in English was still hankering to be put to good use, so when HTML and the World Wide Web came along, I decided to do a bit of writing and then self-publish on the Web. I had no idea whether anyone would actually read any of my stuff, but <a href="https://www.reasontorock.com/closing/feedback.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few people seemed to like it pretty well</a>.  </p>

<p>Another adventure! </p>

<p>Almost from the beginning of my web writing, though, I began to design and code software that could help structure and publish an entire web site. </p>

<p>This work evolved into what is now known as Notenik, and I still use it for website construction. </p>

<p>But rather than develop an app that was purely a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">static site generator</a>, I opted to create a general-purpose tool that could additionally be used to do any or all of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a simple collection of notes; </li>
<li>Maintain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal wiki</a>; </li>
<li>Maintain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal knowledge base</a>; </li>
<li>Outline a set of thoughts and ideas, with the option of fleshing these out in place, eventually creating a longer, well-structured work; </li>
<li>Maintain and organizing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/personaltech/make-digital-commonplace-book.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital commonplace book</a>, containing ideas and quotations from others; </li>
<li>Store info in a custom set of fields, uniquely tailored for each different collection of notes; </li>
<li>Allow users to write using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown</a>, and then convert to HTML as needed; </li>
<li>Import. export, sort, filter and format almost any type of personal information, for almost any purpose. </li>
</ul>

<p>So exploring these many possiblities has been an adventure of its own, and one that is still ongoing! </p>

<p>But Notenik is also intended to foster a sense of adventure <em>for its users</em>. Because it&#8217;s such a flexible tool, with such an extensive (and still evolving) set of features, Notenik users also get to be inventors, first imagining what they might want to do with Notenik, and then assembling the relevant pieces in order to turn their dreams into reality.   </p>

<p>So my intent for <em>Adventures with Notenik</em> is to create a blog containing writings from myself and others, each one describing a particular little adventure with the software, focusing on the &#8220;enterprise and enthusiasm&#8221; going into each effort. </p>

<p>I envision these posts as being inspiring and suggestive, but not necessarily being comprehensive &#8220;how-to&#8221; pieces (although occasional links to relevant sections of the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-knowledge-base.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowledge Base</a> will no doubt be helpful). </p>

<p>So here&#8217;s our first post for the blog. </p>

<p>I look forward to writing more, and also to see what others come up with! </p>

<p>(BTW, <em>Adventures with Notenik</em> now replaces both the <em>News</em> and <em>Usage</em> sections of the website that were there before, if you&#8217;re keeping track.) </p>
