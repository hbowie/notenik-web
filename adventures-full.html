							Building Something Without Having to Order the Cement
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 47 &bull;  Thursday, May 22, 2025</p>

					<p>A few years ago I came across a really good book by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/steve-lohr" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Lohr</a> with a mouthful of a title: <a href="https://amzn.to/4koTf7A" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go To: The Story Of The Math Majors, Bridge Players, Engineers, Chess Wizards, Scientists And Iconoclasts Who Were The Hero Programmers Of The Software Revolution</a>. (And yes, if huge numbers of you rush out and order copies from Amazon using this link, there is some remote chance of me receiving a payment from them at some distant point in the future. So consider yourself forewarned. But I digress&#8230;.) </p>

<p>The book featured a number of great interviews with early pioneers in what is now called computer science, and quotes from a couple of these resonated strongly with my own experience. </p>

<p>The first is from an interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ken Thompson</a>: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>He has called programming an addiction of sorts, and it was in the Berkeley computer center that he got hooked. Sitting in the Bell Labs offices years later, he described the appeal as having all the craftsman’s satisfactions of making things, without the cost and trouble of procuring the materials. “It’s like building something where you don’t have to order the cement,” Thompson said. “You create a world of your own, your own environment, and you never leave this room.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other is from an interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sayre" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Sayre</a>, talking about the days at IBM when the field of software development was trying to incorporate practices from hardware engineering: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The disciplines of hardware engineering fit uneasily in the more ethereal realm of software. “Software is a much more plastic object than hardware,” Sayre said. “You whip it up, squeeze it, and you can dream.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is feelings like these that run through me whenever I sit down at my Mac to work on Notenik. More than that, though, it is a desire to foster some of these same feelings for myself and others when we are <em>using</em> Notenik, or when contributing to Notenik through discussions on the <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik Forum</a>. My favorite software is open-ended, a sort of doorway into a magical kingdom with evolving rules and no fixed boundaries, and my intent with Notenik has always been to create such software, and such an experience for its users. </p>

<p>And on that note, I&#8217;m grateful for everyone who has used Notenik, and especially to those who have reached out to me to express their ideas and feelings about the software over the months and now, yes, years. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s an ongoing journey, and I&#8217;m thrilled to have others along for the ride. </p>

						<a class="invisi-link" href="adventures/tech-priorities-for-note-taking.html"?>
							Tech Priorities for Note-Taking
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 46 &bull;  Monday, April 7, 2025</p>

					<p>There are a number of technology priorities for me when I consider how to store notes that I take. </p>

<p>And, since I&#8217;m the author of the Mac app Notenik, these are naturally the priorities addressed by that app! </p>

<p>But whether you use Notenik or not, I think these priorities are deserving of your consideration. </p>

<section id="section-for-1-text-files">

<h2 id="1-text-files">1. Text Files</h2>

<p>This is the foundation on which everything else is built. All data is stored in text files, and those files are easily accessible by the user. Files can be opened using any text editor. Nothing is hidden. Everything can be easily backed up, copied or moved, using any number of different methods, and to any modern computing platform. Files can be organized into folders/directories, and those can be stored anywhere the user likes. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-2-html">

<h2 id="2-html">2. HTML</h2>

<p>HTML is the <em>lingua franca</em> for modern digital communications. (And, of course, it can be stored in text files!) It is universal and non-proprietary, and it can be used to publish any sort of text, along with images, audio and video. And so, whatever else we do, we must ultimately be able to express it in HTML. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-3-markdown">

<h2 id="3-markdown">3. Markdown </h2>

<p>HTML, despite its other advantages, is not a great language for authoring, or for content management.  This is where lightweight markup languages come into play, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown</a> hits a sweet spot of maximum lightness while retaining a reasonable degree of expressiveness. It&#8217;s also well supported by a large and ever-growing set of tools available on pretty much every computing platform. </p>

<p>It must be noted that extensions to the original Markdown spec can be problematic, as they are not uniformly or evenly implemented across all platforms. However, while standardization is not perfect, there is a <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-defined set of extensions</a> that are widely supported. And agreement on extended syntax seems to be gradually progressing, as one might expect, since the whole community benefits from a common syntax. </p>

<p>The other point here is that all extended syntax should meet the first two priorities: that is, it can be clearly stored in user-accessible text files, and it can be easily and reliably converted to HTML that can be displayed using any modern web browser. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-4-metadata-aka-fields">

<h2 id="4-metadata-aka-fields">4. Metadata (aka Fields)</h2>

<p>I said earlier that HTML is not a great language for content management. What I meant is that, while HTML can be easily used to <em>present</em> the organization of content, it provides no ready ability to dynamically sort and filter and summarize content to prepare it for display. This is where metadata becomes important (and we use  <em>fields</em> within Notenik to store such data). </p>

<p>Again, though, such data should be stored in text files, should sit comfortably alongside Markdown, and should be easily converted to HTML. </p>

<p>There are several different sets of conventions for encoding metadata alongside Markdown. Notenik uses its own. Other apps use YAML. And then there is the MultiMarkdown convention. </p>

<p>However all of these conventions rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name%E2%80%93value_pair" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">name-value pairs</a>, with fairly slight variations in formatting, and an app such as Notenik can pretty easily detect and respect whichever convention is being used in existing files, and allow a user the option of selecting whichever convention they prefer. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-5-interoperable-data">

<h2 id="5-interoperable-data">5. Interoperable Data</h2>

<p>It should be easy to access your data — including both Markdown and metadata — from multiple pieces of software. In other words, you should avoid lock-in with one particular tool. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-6-free-and-open-source-software">

<h2 id="6-free-and-open-source-software">6. Free and Open-Source Software</h2>

<p>And finally, at least some of the software you use should be open-source, to ensure that your data is never held hostage by a for-profit concern. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-bottom-line">

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Notenik has been built to respect all of these priorities, as defined above. </p>

<p>Again, though, whether you use Notenik or not, I think it wise to consider all of these priorities for your own note-taking efforts. </p>

<p><em>Edited on 8 Apr 2025 to note variations in metadata formatting, and to add the word &#8220;free&#8221; in conjunction with &#8220;open-source&#8221;.</em> </p>

							Creating a Portable Wisdom Feed
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 45 &bull;  Wednesday, April 2, 2025</p>

					<p>One of the things I use Notenik for is to maintain a list of my <a href="https://hbowie.net/authors/index.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorite quotations</a>. I&#8217;ve compiled quite a few, and they are all meaningful to me, in addition to being reasonably concise. </p>

<p>Sometime ago I made some changes to Notenik so that I could easily see a random selection from this collection each morning: my quote of the day, so to speak. And I was frankly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. </p>

<p>So then I wondered if it might be worth sharing these with others. My first thought was to create an RSS feed containing each day&#8217;s quote. But then I ran into a problem: how could Notenik keep track of these random selections? </p>

<p>After some cogitating on the problem, I came up with the idea of adding a new field type to Notenik, to be called <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/date-picked.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Date Picked</a>. This way, as each random selection is made, Notenik would have a place to store a timestamp recording the date and time of each selection. And then, of course, a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/script-files.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">script file</a> could filter and sort using this field, so that the selections could be presented in reverse chronological order (latest first), as is standard for feeds of all kinds. </p>

<p>I then added a new variation on the Notenik <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/custom-url-scheme.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom URL Scheme</a> so that I could perform a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-url-open-command.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">randompick</a> operation — meaning select a note at random from the specified collection, then set the date picked to the current date and time. This way I could easily perform this operation by launching a link within Notenik, or through any other utility (such as Keyboard Maestro) capable of opening a URL. </p>

<p>(Somewhere along the way I decided to dub this whole thing the <em>Portable Wisdom</em> project, partly because I own the portablewisdom.com domain name, but mostly just because this phrase has resonated with me for a long time.) </p>

<p>Next I created a new Notenik <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/Hbowie-23/blob/main/factory/templates/wisdom-atom-template.xml" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">template</a> or <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/Hbowie-23/blob/main/factory/templates/wisdom-page.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two</a> to generate an <a href="https://hbowie.net/portablewisdom/feeds/atom.xml" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atom feed</a> and a corresponding <a href="https://hbowie.net/portablewisdom/index.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web page</a> so that I could share the most recent twenty of these selections. </p>

<p>And then, of course, a <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/Hbowie-23/blob/main/factory/scripts/wisdom.tsv" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">script file</a> to sort the quotes and generate the output via the templates. </p>

<p>And then I created another variation on the Custom URL Scheme so that a URL could be used to <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-url-run-command.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run a Notenik script file</a>. Again, this could be invoked from within Notenik or by any other handy utility. </p>

<p>So now each morning, just through a few quick actions, I can see my <em>Portable Wisdom</em> quote for the day, and also share it with others. </p>

<p>And although picking a quote at random each day might seem — well, sort of random — I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s this very randomness that I&#8217;m enjoying — as opposed to the usual relentless need to read and say something <em>pointed</em> and <em>relevant</em> about the latest bit of news that&#8217;s happened. Hopefully each of these quotes carries some bit of timeless wisdom, and it&#8217;s nice to reflect on that for a minute, before being swept up in the never-ending tide of the other stuff. </p>

<p>So feel free to subscribe to this <a href="https://hbowie.net/portablewisdom/feeds/atom.xml" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portable Wisdom feed</a> if you&#8217;re into RSS. I&#8217;ll also be posting these from time to time to my <a href="https://c.im/@hbowie" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastodon account</a>, if you&#8217;d like to follow along there. </p>

						<a class="invisi-link" href="adventures/starter-packs-for-notenik.html"?>
							Starter Packs for Notenik
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 44 &bull;  Saturday, March 8, 2025</p>

					<p>Version 16.5.0 of Notenik adds support for custom Starter Packs. </p>

<p>Unlike many other (perhaps <em>all</em>&#8230;?) somewhat comparable note-taking apps, Notenik allows you to tailor each different collection (aka <em>folder</em>) full of notes in several meaningful ways. Most significantly, you can customize the particular set of <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/field-labels-and-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">field labels and field types</a> used within each Collection, so that different collections can be used for quite different purposes. And then you can also tailor the look and feel of a collection by changing the CSS used for the display of its notes, and even the HTML layout used. </p>

<p>All of these changes can be made simply by editing a few text files but, for some time now, when you create a new collection, Notenik has allowed you to choose from a number of different <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/built-in-starter-packs.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starter Packs</a> that can be used to initialize your new collection with a particular configuration. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve added new Starter Packs to Notenik every once in a while but, still, as the developer, I&#8217;ve been the only person with the power to create a new one, or to enable other users to make use of one. </p>

<p>Up until now, that is! </p>

<p>The latest version includes two related features. </p>

<p>The first is called <em>Clone</em>, and can be found beneath the <em>File</em> menu. This function will copy the selected collection to a new location, but leaving behind the actual notes that make up the content of the collection. </p>

<p>The user may then use their trusty text editor to make any further changes to the clone (such as adding more sample data), before using it as a custom Starter Pack. </p>

<p>Once these further edits are complete, the user may copy this cloned collection into the <code>Starter Packs</code> folder within the user&#8217;s iCloud Drive Notenik folder. </p>

<p>It will then become available as an option the next time the user executes the process of creating a <em>New Collection</em>. </p>

<p>Note that, when exchanging Starter Packs with other users, it will be most convenient to first compress each Pack into a single Zip file. The user will then need to decompress the Pack before making use of it. </p>

<p>Also note that the Notenik Discourse Forum now has a <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/c/starter-pack-sharing/22" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new category</a> set up specifically for Starter Pack Sharing. </p>

						<a class="invisi-link" href="adventures/using-notenik-as-an-app-launcher.html"?>
							Using Notenik as an App Launcher
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 43 &bull;  Saturday, February 22, 2025</p>

					<p>The <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-16.4.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16.4.0 version of Notenik</a> makes it a little easier to use Notenik as a Mac application launcher. </p>

<p>Is this a good idea? </p>

<p>Heck, I don&#8217;t know. </p>

<p>There are certainly many other ways to launch an app on your Mac, including software designed specifically for this purpose. </p>

<p>But you be the judge. </p>

<p>Let me show you how you can use Notenik in this way, and then you decide if this use case makes any sense. </p>

<section id="section-for-step-1-create-an-apps-catalog">

<h3 id="step-1-create-an-apps-catalog">Step 1: Create an Apps Catalog</h3>

<p>This is pretty easy to do. <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/creating-and-tailoring-a-collection-of-notes.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a new Collection</a> somewhere handy, such as the Notenik Folder within iCloud Drive. You can just pick <em>Basic Notes</em> as your starting point. Call it whatever makes sense to you, such as <code>Apps Catalog</code>. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-step-2-import-your-applications-metadata">

<h3 id="step-2-import-your-applications-metadata">Step 2: Import your Applications Metadata</h3>

<p>Now it&#8217;s time to <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/import-apps-folder.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Import your Apps Folder</a> by selecting <em>File > Import > Apps Catalog</em>. </p>

<p>You&#8217;ll then see the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/import-settings.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Import Settings</a> window. Make sure <em>Additional Fields</em> is set to <em>Add</em>, and <em>Rows (aka Notes)</em> is set to <em>Match and Add</em>. </p>

<p>Now pick your primary <em>Applications</em> folder as the import source, and click <em>OK</em>. </p>

<p>Notenik will then import the names of those applications, along with a few metadata fields, into your Apps Catalog. </p>

<p>Note that this step can be repeated later as changes are made to your <em>Applications</em> folder. New applications will be added, and any firm metadata changes will be updated. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-step-3-add-any-useful-info">

<h3 id="step-3-add-any-useful-info">Step 3: Add Any Useful Info</h3>

<p>In particular, you can use the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tags.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tags</a> field to categorize your apps in any way that is meaningful to you. For example, I&#8217;ve assigned <code>markdown</code> to the various apps that can be used as Markdown editors/parsers. Note that, although the Tags field may be initially populated with an app&#8217;s <em>Application Category</em>, it will not be overridden by a later import if the field has been user-modified. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-step-4-set-a-keyboard-shortcut">

<h3 id="step-4-set-a-keyboard-shortcut">Step 4: Set a Keyboard Shortcut</h3>

<p>Start by using the <em>Collection > Copy Notenik URL for Collection</em> item to get a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/custom-url-scheme.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik Custom URL</a> into your system clipboard. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what this might look like, when you paste it into an empty document using your text editor. </p>

<pre><code>notenik://open?path=/Users/hbowie/Library/Mobile%20Documents/iCloud~com~powersurgepub~notenik~shared/Documents/Apps%20Catalog
</code></pre>

<p>Now add <code>&amp;select=action</code> to the end of this string, with no intervening spaces or punctuation, so that the result looks something like this. </p>

<pre><code>notenik://open?path=/Users/hbowie/Library/Mobile%20Documents/iCloud~com~powersurgepub~notenik~shared/Documents/Apps%20Catalog&amp;select=action
</code></pre>

<p>Now assign this URL to an available keyboard shortcut, using whatever app/tool you prefer. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyboard Maestro</a>. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve assigned the Hot Key CTRL-OPT-R to a Macro titled &#8216;Notenik Apps Catalog&#8217;. The Macro only contains one Action, of type <em>Open a URL</em>. Then paste the complete URL you&#8217;ve created into the URL field. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-step-5-type-your-keyboard-shortcut">

<h3 id="step-5-type-your-keyboard-shortcut">Step 5: Type Your Keyboard Shortcut</h3>

<p>Now when you type your new Keyboard Shortcut, two things will happen: </p>
<ol>
<li>Notenik will open your Apps Catalog (or bring it to the front, if it&#8217;s already open); </li>
<li>Notenik will pop up its <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/select-a-note-for-action.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Note Selector</a> window. </li>
</ol>

</section>

<section id="section-for-step-6-select-your-application">

<h3 id="step-6-select-your-application">Step 6: Select Your Application</h3>

<p>Now you can select one of your applications, via either of two means: </p>
<ul>
<li>Type three or more letters found anywhere in the name of the application; </li>
<li>Type a pound sign, followed by three or more letters found in the <em>Tags</em> field of any of your App Notes. </li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever method you use, select the desired app from the list that results (if it&#8217;s not already selected).  </p>

<p>Next make sure the Action popup at the bottom of the <em>Note Selector</em> window is set to <em>Launch Link</em>. (Note that this popup will default to whatever value was last selected for the the given Collection, so you should only have to pick this once.) </p>

<p>Then hit the <em>OK</em> button, or simply press <em>return</em> on your keyboard. </p>

<p>Then your App should launch, using the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/link.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link to Launch field</a>! </p>

<p>Voila! </p>

							What Makes Notenik Different? Collection Templates
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 42 &bull;  Thursday, February 6, 2025</p>

					<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to figure out what makes Notenik different from all the other note-taking, Markdown-parsing, text-file-wrangling apps out there. </p>

<p>So let&#8217;s start with the most significant, core differentiator: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each folder of text files managed by Notenik has its own unique <em>template</em> file&#8230; </p></li>
<li><p>And each template file defines a set of <em>fields</em> for the notes within that folder&#8230; </p></li>
<li><p>And each field is defined by a <em>label</em>, a <em>type</em>, and (sometimes) a <em>configuration</em>&#8230; </p></li>
<li><p>And the file extension for the template file specifies the file extension to be used for notes created within that folder. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example of how this works in practice. </p>

<p>Here are the contents of a sample template file, which is just an ordinary text file that you can open with your favorite text editor. Here I&#8217;m using BBEdit. </p>

<p><img src="images/Sample Template File.png" alt="Sample template file, viewed within BBEdit" /> </p>

<p>And here&#8217;s what the <em>Edit</em> tab will look like when adding a new note to the collection (aka <em>folder</em>) using this template. </p>

<p><img src="images/Sample Edit Window.png" alt="The Edit Tab within Notenik" /> </p>

<p>So let me just point out a few interesting bits here: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every note must start with a Title field, and conclude with a Body field (although they can be given different labels). </p></li>
<li><p>In between those two, a note can have many different fields, of many different types. </p></li>
<li><p>The field type will, among other things, determine what sort of widget appears on the <em>Edit</em> tab for that field, when adding a new note within that folder, or when editing an existing note. </p></li>
<li><p>Some field types, such as <em>status</em>, can also have a configuration specified in the template. In this case, the allowable status values are being specified, and these are the values that will appear in the drop-down menu when selecting a value for this field. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So here&#8217;s what a sample note might look like after being added to this collection, and when viewed on Notenik&#8217;s <em>Display</em> tab. </p>

<p><img src="images/Sample Display Tab.png" alt="The Display Tab within Notenik" /> </p>

<p>And, just to round things out, and remove the last bit of mystery, here&#8217;s what the resulting note file might look like (again viewing with BBEdit). </p>

<p><img src="images/Sample Note File.png" alt="Sample note file" /> </p>

<p>And then, perhaps, I should make one final point for today&#8217;s <em>Adventure</em> post. </p>

<p>One may always edit a Notenik template file directly, if one is so inclined, and this is sometimes the best way to build some new and exotic sort of collection. </p>

<p>However, direct editing of the template file is generally a last resort, and Notenik offers these other ways of tailoring a template file, before resorting to direct editing. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>When creating a new collection, Notenik currently offers sixteen different <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/starting-collection-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starting Collection Types</a> from which you may choose, each with a different collection template. Even when creating something new, you can help yourself by picking a good starting point from this list.  </p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Collection Settings</em> window allows you to pick from several common field labels and types in order to add them to your collection template. </p></li>
<li><p>After initial creation, Notenik offers a handy window to <em>Rename, Add or Remove</em> a field, available beneath the <em>Collection</em> menu. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s generally best to exercise these options to get you as far as possible, and then perform direct editing of your template file to implement any final tweaks. </p>

<p>Hopefully this post has helped to explain one of the key ways in which Notenik differs from other similar apps. </p>

<p>Now, as to <em>why</em> Notenik works this way&#8230;? </p>

<p>Well, when creating a list of items, with each row containing a number of columns, I often wished to have one or more columns containing some significant amount of text&#8230; but then a traditional spreadsheet app quickly gets awkward and unwieldy. </p>

<p>And then when writing some significant chunks of text, I often wished to organize many such chunks into a coherent collection, and then sort, filter and format those chunks using some set of discrete fields, in addition to the more free-form bits of text&#8230; but then a traditional document editing app proves disappointing. </p>

<p>So Notenik attempts to provide a happy medium in between these two extremes, and the collection template file is the key to pulling this all together. </p>

					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 41 &bull;  Wednesday, January 15, 2025</p>

					<p>After publishing the <a href="https://notenik.app/web-guide/index.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Creating a Website using Notenik</a> in October of last year, one of Notenik&#8217;s longtime users published <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/website-creation-guide/592/4?u=hbowie" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a list of links</a> that might be helpful to website creators. </p>

<p>And on that list was a site created by <a href="https://blakewatson.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blake Watson</a>, called <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML for People</a>. His site is in the form of a web book, offering a tutorial on HTML for those new to webmaking. It walks a new user through the entire process of building a personal website, and makes the entire journey easy and fun. </p>

<p>I really liked Blake&#8217;s site, and it made me wonder if I could create a companion web book that would supplement Blake&#8217;s instructions, following the same trail, but at every step showing how Notenik could be used to perform the same tasks. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on this companion book for the last several months, and I&#8217;m happy to say that it&#8217;s now as complete as I can think to make it. </p>

<p>(That being said, I&#8217;m eager to hear feedback from others, and expect to make further improvements to the book as feedback comes in.) </p>

<p>There are really four somewhat separate achievements here. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>I learned a bunch of stuff that I hadn&#8217;t known before. </p></li>
<li><p>I realized that Notenik had numerous shortcomings, and I&#8217;ve tried to rectify all of these that I could identify. You&#8217;ll find these changes sprinkled through <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-history.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent updates</a>, starting from Version 15.5.0. The last few of these have just been released, in <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-16.2.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Version 16.2.0</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve finalized (at least for now) and published my companion guide, which I&#8217;m calling an <a href="https://notenik.app/web-intro/index.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intro to Website Creation using Notenik</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>This tutorial makes use of a new Notenik Starter Pack, # 16, titled <em>HTML for People demo</em>, providing all of the Notenik folders and files needed to make your way through the tutorial. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This has been a very rewarding three-month journey, and I&#8217;m thankful to Blake Watson for his site, and for the Notenik users active in <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the app&#8217;s Discourse forum</a>, who are continually finding ways to make Notenik a better, more useful Mac app. </p>

							Notenik Turns Sweet Sixteen!
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 40 &bull;  Friday, December 20, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik version 16.0.0 is out, just in time for the holidays! </p>

<p>Starting with the big picture, this means Notenik has had roughly 150 significant releases, starting with 1.1.0 on July 15, 2019. This works out to about 1 release every two weeks, over a period of five and a half years! And Notenik today has an average rating of 4.8 stars out of 5 in the Mac App Store, based on every rating ever made, starting with that first release. So this feels like a milestone worth celebrating! </p>

<p>Zooming in to the details of this release, I&#8217;ll start with the invention of a couple of new Markdown extensions. I&#8217;ve added a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/start-a-segment.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">segment</a> command that can be used to start and end a portion of your writing that you wish to embed within a <code>div</code> or an <code>aside</code>, as examples. And then there&#8217;s the new <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/inject-block-attributes.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inject</a> that can be used to inject common attributes (class, id, and/or style) into the following block element (such as a <code>p</code> or a <code>ul</code>). </p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s my favorite. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://nova.app/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nova</a> a lot recently, and I was missing some way to open a folder in Nova when starting from a Notenik project folder. Then I discovered a way to do it using <a href="https://help.panic.com/nova/url-schemes/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nova URL Schemes</a>, and so there&#8217;s now an application general setting to <em>Gen Open in Nova Items</em>, and turning this on will achieve the desired effect. Very handy if you&#8217;re using Nova regularly! </p>

<p>Oh, and I added support for Markdown highlighting, using the syntax found in the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#highlight" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown Guide to Extended Syntax</a>. </p>

<p>And then there were a couple of other changes to improve handling of sync conflicts (when using a third-party sync service), and to allow a project folder to become a user&#8217;s Essential Collection. </p>

					<p>Notenik version 15.9.0 is now available from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac App Store</a>, and is <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-15.9.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chock full of improvements</a> (including a few fixes). </p>

<p>As with our <a href="https://notenik.app/adventures/easier-webmaking-with-notenik-15.8.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prior adventure</a>, many of the enhancements here were inspired by working my way further through Blake Watson&#8217;s excellent web book <em><a href="https://htmlforpeople.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML for People</a></em>. </p>

<p>Watson&#8217;s book is for beginners, but I keep learning new things, and seeing new ways to make Notenik easier to use, and this release includes more of these sorts of refinements. </p>

<p>And while my Notenik companion to <em>HTML for People</em> is not yet complete, I think it is now far enough along to make it available for any interested reviewers. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to publish it at <a href="https://notenik.app/web-intro/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notenik.app/web-intro</a>. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re at all interested, I&#8217;d love to hear any feedback you might have. </p>

<p>And, as always, bug reports can be filed and enhancement requests can be submitted at <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discourse.notenik.app</a>. </p>

					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 38 &bull;  Tuesday, November 26, 2024</p>

					<p>A Notenik user recently turned me on to a great web book, <em><a href="https://www.htmlforpeople.com/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML for People</a></em>, authored by Blake Watson. </p>

<p>Blake&#8217;s book takes the reader through a quick and painless introduction to Hypertext Markup Language, and makes the point (near and dear to my own heart) that HTML is not just for technologists, but is a document format meant to be accessible to everyone. </p>

<p>Blake&#8217;s how-to gave me the idea of trying to write a companion document that would walk a user through the same steps of simple website creation, but using Notenik, rather than straight HTML. </p>

<p>That companion document is still in work, but a funny thing happened along the way. </p>

<p>I discovered that some of the Notenik steps I was trying to describe were actually harder than they needed to be. </p>

<p>And so, I fashioned some enhancements to make things a bit easier. </p>

<p>First, I realized (finally, I guess) that what I&#8217;ve been calling a <em>parent realm</em> in Notenik for so long has actually evolved into something that might as well be called a <em>project folder</em>.  So I made that nomenclature change, which seemed a valuable step towards making Notenik a little more straightforward, and a little less esoteric. </p>

<p>And then, once I had made that change (in my own thinking, as well as in the software and documentation), I wondered why in the world simple text files (such as README and LICENSE files) were not visible within Notenik when they appeared at the top level of a project folder. </p>

<p>And so, now they are. </p>

<p>And then, I wanted to make Class and Status fields visible within a content collection, without the user having to worry about them initially, but both fields looked a bit awkward with empty values, so I wondered why Notenik didn&#8217;t have a way to specify default values for those fields. </p>

<p>And so now it does. </p>

<p>And then, when I was describing how a script file could be viewed and edited, I realized that the long-time file extension of &#8216;<code>.tcz</code>&#8217; that I had been using — even though it made it easy for Notenik to recognize those files — made it difficult for other apps to recognize what was basically a tab-delimited file format. And so, I thought, why not allow script files to have file extensions of &#8216;<code>.tsv</code>&#8217; (for <em>tab-separated values</em>), so long as they are stored in a folder named <code>scripts</code>? </p>

<p>And so now it&#8217;s much easier to open and edit a script file using Numbers or Excel or even <a href="https://www.moderncsv.com/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern CSV</a>. </p>

<p>And then Blake suggested the user download one or more classless CSS frameworks and try those out, and I realized that sounded pretty cool, but there was no way to easily download one of those things and apply it within Notenik. </p>

<p>And so now there is. </p>

<p>And then I realized that, while it was easy to apply CSS and load image files within Notenik, there was no easy way to transfer those things to a website being built from a Notenik collection. </p>

<p>And so now there is. </p>

<p>And I&#8217;m still not done going through all of Blake&#8217;s book! So no doubt there will be more to come. </p>

<p>But that already seemed like quite a lot, and I was getting close to two weeks without a Notenik release, so I&#8217;ve bundled up all these enhancements and released them into the wild as Notenik 15.8.0. </p>

<p>Available now from the Mac App Store. </p>

							Notenik's Flexible Seq Field
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 37 &bull;  Tuesday, October 29, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik tries to follow Alan Kay&#8217;s dictum that &#8220;<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-story-behind-Alan-Kay-s-adage-Simple-things-should-be-simple-complex-things-should-be-possible" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible</a>,&#8221; and this is nowhere more evident than in the many possible uses of the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/seq.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seq field</a>. </p>

<p>A Sequence identifier is meant to be an arbitrary value whose only purpose is to establish a position within a sequence. </p>

<p>A Sequence identifier can consist of letters or numbers, or some combination of the two. </p>

<p>In many scenarios, it would be most useful for each Note in a Collection to have a unique Seq value, but Notenik does not insist on this. </p>

<p>Sequence values will sort into what will generally appear to be a &#8220;normal&#8221; sequence, based on an algorithm of incrementing on the right and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(arithmetic)" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carrying</a> overflow to the left. </p>

<p>As you would expect, a value of &#8216;12&#8217; will appear after a value of &#8216;2&#8217;. </p>

<p>But also a value of &#8216;AB&#8217; will sort after a value of &#8216;B&#8217;. </p>

<p>A structure can be implied by using a series of values separated by periods, or dots: something like &#8216;15.3.1&#8217;, and this might imply that the Note so identified should be treated as a &#8220;child&#8221; of &#8216;15.3&#8217;. </p>

<p>In fact, Seq values can be used as part of an outlining scheme, and there is a separate post on <a href="outlining-with-notenik.html" class="wiki-link">Outlining with Notenik</a>. </p>

<p>A Seq field can be useful to impose some sort of taxonomy on your Notes, but Notenik itself does not define any particular taxonomy to be used. </p>

<p>Note that there are several different sort options that make use of the Seq field. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Seq + Title</code> will sort everything by Seq and, if there are duplicates, will then sort by their Title fields. </li>
<li><code>Tasks by Seq</code> can be useful if the Seq field is being used as a priority indicator; in addition, a Status field will be expected, and completed tasks will sort separately from tasks still to be completed. </li>
<li><code>Tags + Seq</code> can be useful if you are using the Seq field for some sort of priority within Tag values. </li>
<li><code>Date + Seq</code> can be useful if you are using the Seq field to enter a time of day. </li>
<li><code>Rank + Seq + Title</code> can be used if you wish the Seq field to be used within a separate Rank field. </li>
<li><code>Folder + Seq + Title</code> can be used to sort by Seq within each subfolder. </li>
</ul>

					<p>My original personal — and still most important — Notenik use case is website creation. </p>

<p>And yet I know that Notenik users have struggled over the years trying to figure out how to fashion their own sites using Notenik. </p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m <em>trying</em> to make things difficult. It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve been doing this for so long that I tend to take a lot of knowledge for granted. </p>

<p>And so, based on <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/the-image-slug-variable-isnt-producing-any-output/591/3?u=hbowie" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent feedback</a>, I&#8217;ve taken a couple of additional steps to make things a bit easier for those who might be trying to use Notenik as a static site generator. </p>

<p>The first is publication of a <a href="https://notenik.app/web-guide/index.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more complete tutorial</a> on the subject, always available from the <a href="https://notenik.app/docs.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docs page</a> of the Notenik.app website. </p>

<p>The second consists of some improvements to Notenik itself, and to the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/website.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website starter pack</a>, just released in <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-15.5.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik 15.5.0</a>. </p>

<p>Hopefully this will prove helpful for those Mac users trying to create their own websites. If there&#8217;s other stuff that&#8217;s tripping you up, or that you think could be improved, I would encourage you to post something on the <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik Discourse Forum</a>. It&#8217;s a friendly, helpful group that hangs out there, and I respond quickly to any new posts. </p>

					<p>Anyone who&#8217;s been seriously collecting quotations for any length of time knows that many casual quotation sites offer lots of &#8220;feel good&#8221; quotations that are often attributed to a particular author, without identifying the precise source of the quotation. And so, perhaps, it is not surprising that many of these &#8220;quotations&#8221; turn out to be <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">misquoted and/or misattributed</a>. </p>

<p>So it&#8217;s good to know that one of the more reliable sources for quotations is <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiQuote.org</a>, one of the lesser-know siblings of big brother WikiPedia. WikiQuote will generally provide a verified author, source title and date for any quotation, and its collection of quotations is pretty extensive. </p>

<p>WikiQuote has been around for quite some time, and my old app <a href="https://iwisdom.en.softonic.com/mac" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iWisdom</a> used to have a handy feature that allowed a user to dowload a particular quote from that site. </p>

<p>Notenik <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-15.4.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version15.4.0</a> now adds a similar ability, using <a href="https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwiftSoup</a> to parse an author&#8217;s page on WikiQuote, and then allowing the Notenik user to specify a search string that will allow them to zero in on a particular quotation of interest, and then bring it over into their personal Notenik commonplace book. </p>

<p>Because we&#8217;re parsing a web page, and not reading information from a database, the retrieval process is certainly not perfect, but I believe it&#8217;s good enough to often be useful, saving the time and potential inaccuracies associated with manually typing in a particular quotation. </p>

<p>For those of you assembling digital commonplace books, I hope you find this new feature to be of use! </p>

							Why Is the Notenik File Format Different?
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 33 &bull;  Monday, September 23, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik recognizes and supports several different file formats, including MultiMarkdown with its metadata,  as well as Markdown with YAML frontmatter. </p>

<p>But Notenik has its own file format, which is slightly different from these others. </p>

<p>Why is that? </p>

<p>There are a number of reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Historical happenstance. I devised the Notenik file format after learning of MultiMarkdown but before the use of YAML frontmatter became popular. </p></li>
<li><p>A CMS/database influence. With the Notenik format, everything is a field, and everything has a label, including the Title and the Body of each note. To some extent, this just reflects my long history doing database development. And also my prior use of the Drupal content management system, in which every field is explicitly named. </p></li>
<li><p>Maximum field flexibility. Notenik allows the use of multiple Markdown fields within a note. A second Markdown field, for example, might be used as a teaser or preview for a blog post. So rather than structure a Notenik file as a single Markdown document with some optional metadata in front, I chose to structure it so that Markdown (and a variety of other data types) could be accomodated in other fields. </p></li>
<li><p>Preference for readability over bare-bones data entry. Because every field has a field title, and because blank lines are used to separate fields, a Notenik file is highly readable by anyone opening it using a text editor. And Notenik expects to take that formatting off of your hands when creating new notes. On the other hand, for users who create text-based notes using nothing but a text editor, the Notenik format requires a few additional keystrokes. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So while I try to maintain maximum interoperability with these other formats, Notenik continues to prefer its own &#8211; slightly different, slightly quirky, but very straightforward &#8211; format. </p>

<p>See the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/note-file-format.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik Knowledge Base</a> for a complete description of the Notenik file format. </p>

							Why Notenik is Shrouded in Perpetual Obscurity
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 32 &bull;  Monday, September 9, 2024</p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve had more than one user stumble across Notenik, try it out, and then ask &#8220;How have I not come across this before?&#8221; </p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m <em>trying</em> to keep it a secret. </p>

<p>But Notenik does have a sort of &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; of attributes that seem to keep it from becoming a household word. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>It&#8217;s only available for the Mac.</em> Availability on multiple platforms — at least on multiple devices throughout the Apple ecosystem — seems to constitute table stakes for a lot of people these days, including those who write about tech.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>It&#8217;s nowhere near the bleeding edge.</em> Notenik is written in Swift and AppKit, technologies that are well supported by Apple. But it doesn&#8217;t run on Apple Vision Pro, or on the Apple Watch, or even on the iPad or iPhone. And it doesn&#8217;t make use of SwiftUI or any of Apple&#8217;s latest technologies. So it&#8217;s not part of, or adjacent to, any other hot topics for tech writers. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Positive reviews don&#8217;t get much traction.</em> I&#8217;m proud to say that Notenik was very well reviewed in what turned out to be the absolute last print issues of <em>MacFormat</em> and <em>MacLife</em> magazines. And also proud to say that Notenik has an average rating of 4.8 stars in the Mac App Store, with 68 ratings, and reviews that say things like &#8220;A hidden powerhouse.&#8221; But these sorts of positive reviews don&#8217;t actually seem to attract much attention. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Open source but not Unix.</em> Because Notenik is open source software, there&#8217;s no money for advertising. But most of the open source community is focused on command line tools that run on any Unix platform — including, but not limited to, the Mac. So Notenik does not hit the open source sweet spot. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Independent but not Indie.</em> I&#8217;m an independent developer, and I&#8217;m the developer for Notenik. But when people talk about <em>indie developers,</em> they are mostly talking about developers who are independently making a living by selling their software and, increasingly, about game developers. Also, I&#8217;m not using any independent distribution channels for Notenik, so my indie status is compromised by virtue of distribution through the App Store.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>Not popular enough for the productivity gurus.</em> There seems to be a whole group of writers about productivity tools and techniques these days. These people seemingly make some sort of living writing about how constantly switching from one tool/technique to another, and then back again, makes them more productive — as measured, I suppose, by their ability to churn out more and more of these pieces faster and faster. But perhaps because Notenik is already so well documented, it has not attracted much attention from these sorts of folks. </p></li>
<li><p><em>No plugins.</em> Some tools gain popularity because they allow development of plugins that can be dynamically loaded by their apps. Notenik doesn&#8217;t work like that. So there&#8217;s no room for incidental add-on development and discussion. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, when a recent user discovered Notenik and wondered why he&#8217;d never heard of it before, I was only half-joking when I responded: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Shhh&#8230; it&#8217;s a well kept secret. Only the cognoscenti are allowed to know about it. Welcome to the club! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In all seriousness, though, feel free to tell your friends and neighbors about Notenik. As I said, I&#8217;m not <em>trying</em> to keep it a secret. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s just sort of worked out that way. </p>

					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 31 &bull;  Friday, September 6, 2024</p>

					<p>David Brooks had a good column in the NY Times yesterday: &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/opinion/entertainment-junk-psychology.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Ik4.1aY-F8w9FF0kD2H0&smid=url-share" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Junkification of American Life</a>.&#8221; </p>

<p>In it he talks about the slippery slope of sliding from art to entertainment to distraction, and ending up in a place where the cheap and easy hit always wins out over &#8220;the long flourishing.&#8221; </p>

<p>Although this phrase hadn&#8217;t occurred to me before, my Mac app Notenik is definitely designed for this latter goal. </p>

<p>To wit: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>It&#8217;s designed for use on the Mac, which is itself an example of the long flourishing, and less inclined to be used for the easy hits so often found on phones and tablets. </p></li>
<li><p>Notenik avoids any sort of attention-grabbing tricks. Notenik will never nag you or beg you for attention. Instead it patiently waits for your intention. </p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s not flashy, and its appearance doesn&#8217;t try to entice you with any slick graphics. </p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s designed for the long haul. It&#8217;s all open-source, and all of its data is stored in plain text files. So both the app and its data are designed to be survivable. </p></li>
<li><p>It intentionally avoids the modern app merry-go-round on which users are encouraged to continually try the next shiny new thing, and then try to rebuild their workflows around something new every few months or so. Notenik is designed to be easy and straightforward for initial use, but deep enough to reward ongoing learning and exploration, and flexible enough to be used for many different purposes. </p></li>
<li><p>Its primary focus is on the <a href="https://hbowie.net/tags/written-word.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written word</a>, rather than still or moving images. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So if you&#8217;re trying to adjust your life to consume less junk, and more substance, Notenik is ready to help. </p>

							Inline Hashtags and Postel's Law
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 30 &bull;  Wednesday, September 4, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik 15.2.0 has just hit the streets, and is now available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac App Store</a>. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s got quite a few nice improvements but for today&#8230; </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s talk about tags and Postel&#8217;s Law. </p>

<p>My <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em> defines <em>tag</em> as &#8220;a label attached to someone or something for the purpose of identification or to give other information.&#8221; </p>

<p>Tagging is a well-nigh universal practice for organizing a bunch of notes, and Notenik has always had robust support for tagging. You can find the details <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tags.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the Knowledge Base</a>, if you&#8217;re interested. </p>

<p>But there are different systems for associating a tag with a text-based note, and Notenik has gradually expanded its support in this department.  </p>

<p>Notenik&#8217;s original approach — which is still the default — is to expect the tags to be entered into, and saved as, their own field. Which has always seemed just fine to me. </p>

<p>But many Notenik adventures transpire as the result of an encounter with someone else who does things differently. </p>

<p>And I&#8217;ve always tried to have Notenik adhere to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postel&#8217;s Law</a>, which states: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So another way of entering tags is to make them hashtags, by prepending a hash symbol (&#8216;#&#8217;) to each tag. <a href="https://evantravers.com/articles/2022/02/28/notenik/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evan Travers</a> originally let me know about this, and so Notenik was modified to recognize and preserve hashtags. </p>

<p>And now, I&#8217;ve had a couple of users <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/inline-tags-as-possible-new-feature/543" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">request a third way</a> of associating tags with a note, by entering hashtags directly into the body of a note. </p>

<p>And so now, with the latest release, Notenik now supports this third approach as well, via a new <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tags-handling.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tags Handling</a> option. </p>

<p>The goal, as always, is to maximize interoperability between Notenik and other apps and note-taking systems out there. </p>

							Notenik's Split Personality
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 29 &bull;  Friday, August 30, 2024</p>

					<p>I must confess that my Notenik Mac app has a bit of a split personality. </p>

<p>On the one hand, it stores all of its data in text files and supports Markdown. So it&#8217;s one of many apps designed to maintain folders full of notes written in Markdown and stored as plain text files. So we might call this the &#8220;just a bunch of text files&#8221; personality. </p>

<p>On the other hand, notes can have fields, and the fields can have different labels and types, and different folders can have different sets of fields, and each folder of notes also has a special template text file that provides something like a schema definition for that particular folder. So we might call this the &#8220;personal database&#8221; personality. </p>

<p>So why can&#8217;t Notenik make up its mind, and just be one thing or the other? </p>

<p>Well, because straddling this divide offers so many interesting opportunities, both for development and for use. On the one hand, all of Notenik&#8217;s data is easily accessible, and can be read (and edited!) with any text editor, and many Markdown editors, and many other &#8220;just a bunch of text files&#8221; organizers. On the other hand, all sorts of useful information can be maintained and tracked, and sorted in different ways, and exported to a spreadsheet for further manipulation whenever needed. </p>

<p>This is one reason why Notenik continues to evolve, with a new release every couple of weeks, and with an <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active user community</a>. </p>

<p>And this split personality is one of the main attributes that makes Notenik such a uniquely useful Mac app. </p>

							A Dedicated Outline Tab
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 28 &bull;  Thursday, August 22, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik Version 15.1.0 has just been released into the Mac App Store, and it includes a new, optional, Outline tab that can be displayed when using the Seq and Level fields to build an outline. </p>

<p>You can select this option by selecting <em>Show</em> or <em>Hide</em> Outline Tab, which can be found beneath the Collection menu. </p>

<p>When the tab is shown, it will appear as a third tab on the left side of the Collection window, just to the right of the Tags tab. </p>

<p>This tab will work similarly to the List tab, in terms of working with your Notes, but will allow you to selectively show and collapse sections of your outline by clicking on the conventional disclosure triangles, thus allowing you to focus on one section of your outline at a time, while hiding others that might otherwise obscure your area(s) of focus. </p>

<p><img src="images/outline-tab.jpg " alt="Screenshot of Notenik with Outline tab" title="Screenshot of Notenik with Outline tab shown" /> </p>

<p>This is a great example of a feature engendered by the Notenik Discussion forum, which can be found at <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discourse.notenik.app</a>. Various users there have been indicating for some time that they would like to see such a feature and for a long time I avoided the idea because I couldn&#8217;t quite see a good way to implement it. But users persisted, so I began to explore possibilities with the forum, and with some tentative code, and after a series of betas — each eliciting thoughtful and helpful feedback — things seemed to gel. So a hearty thanks to all of the forum users who participated and provided ideas and feedback! </p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, my original vision for Notenik included not a thing about outlining, and it&#8217;s certainly not a dedicated outliner. But Notenik has evolved into something of a personal information multitool, and outlining has become one of the tools that has proven useful. And while dedicated outliners such as OmniOutliner and Bike have definite advantages, there are also advantages to an outlining tool that fully accommodates accompanying Markdown text, as well as other useful fields, such that your outline is not <em>only</em> an outline. </p>

							Dragging and Dropping Into an Outline
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 27 &bull;  Sunday, August 18, 2024</p>

					<p>The ability to select an item from one location, then drag it to another, and drop it into a desired new location — what we call <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/drag-and-drop-items-mh35852/mac" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drag and drop</a> on a Mac — is a powerfully convenient feature of macOS. </p>

<p>Notenik supports drag and drop in many situations, and two of them are especially suited for use with outlining. </p>

<p>The first involves dragging a note from within an outline to a new location within the same outline. Notenik will conveniently adjust the seq value of the dropped item to fit into its new location, based on the note above that location, and then will move the note from its original location to its new location. </p>

<p>The second involves dragging a note from another collection into a collection that is sorted by seq. In this case Notenik will helpfully adjust/add both seq and level fields to fit the new note into its new location before copying the note to the outline. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found both of these techniques to be helpful in different circumstances, and hopefully you will as well. </p>

					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 26 &bull;  Friday, August 16, 2024</p>

					<p>Any attempt to build an outline will soon run into the following issue: </p>

<p>You&#8217;ve already created a note at a given level, but now want to demote it to a lower level (higher numeric value); this function is generally referred to as <em>indenting</em>, since it typically indents the line below its parent. </p>

<p>And then, if you can indent, you might well also wish at times to be able to <em>outdent</em>: to promote a note to a higher level (lower numeric value). </p>

<p>Notenik provides these two commands beneath the Note menu, along with handy keyboard shortcuts. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>OPT-CMD-]</code> will indent the selected note(s); </li>
<li><code>OPT-CMD-[</code> will outdent the selected note(s). </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>As you create your outline, you will probably want your Collection sorted by <code>Seq + Title</code>. The List tab will then show two columns, one for Seq and one for Title. The Seq field will display first, without any modification. But then the Title values will be padded on the left to reflect your outline structure — making it easier to see the structure of your outline at a glance. The effect will be to create indentation, with each successive level indented a bit further to the right. </p>

<p>And here&#8217;s a tip: you can increase or decrease the amount of padding added per level through a setting in the Notenik Application settings (available beneath the Notenik menu). </p>

<p>In a recent post I talked about <a href="automatically-incrementing-sequence-numbers.html" class="wiki-link">Automatically Incrementing Sequence Numbers</a>, using any of several different methods. The use case for all of these is the user&#8217;s intent to add a new note following an existing note, and keeping the new note in sequence with the preceding one(s). This works well when you are adding on to the end of an outline. </p>

<p>But what if you want to insert something new in the middle somewhere? </p>

<p>In this case, you will first want to select the note currently occupying the position at which you wish to insert the new note, then use the <code>Increment</code> command beneatht the <code>Note</code> menu (or just use the CMD-I keyboard shortcut). The effect of this Increment action will be to increment the Seq value of the selected note — <em>plus all following notes that would otherwise collide</em> &#8211; conveniently making room for the new note. </p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve incremented the Seq values for the existing notes, you can apply any of the methods described in the prior post to add the new note, first selecting the existing note that is to become the new note&#8217;s predecessor. </p>

<p>I find this to be an invaluable tool when I&#8217;m building an outline, and one that I use all the time. </p>

					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 23 &bull;  Wednesday, August 14, 2024</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m making a few updates to the <em>Adventures</em> blog. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The blog post URLs are changing. I had previously been prefixing each post with the date of the post, followed by the title. As things evolved, though, I realized I wanted to use wiki links between some of the entries, and the date prefixes made it harder to translate these links from the Notenik collection to the actual website. Also, I realized that, as these posts began to evolve, I really wanted each post to have a unique title anyway. So the dates are gone. And good riddance, I say. But if you&#8217;ve bookmarked any of these, then you&#8217;ll need to update your bookmarks. Sorry for my lack of prescience on this issue. </p></li>
<li><p>On the Notenik Discourse forum, @ThePrinter made the <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/outlining-with-notenik/530/2?u=hbowie" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent suggestion</a> of modifying the HTML title of each post to place the title of the post before the name of the blog, to make it easier to distinguish between tabs, when viewing more than one. This too has been implemented. </p></li>
<li><p>I had previously been offering two different versions of the blog page, one with full posts, and one only with summaries of each post. But the wiki links between posts also proved problematic when showing a page of full posts, so I&#8217;ve eliminated this version. (I&#8217;d grown to prefer the summaries page anyway; hopefully others feel the same.) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully none of these changes will prove too disruptive for anyone, and together I hope they will smooth the path to continued useful evolution of these <em>Adventures</em>. </p>

							Automatically Incrementing Sequence Numbers
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 22 &bull;  Tuesday, August 13, 2024</p>

					<p>This post is part of an evolving series that can somewhat usefully be read in order. </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="outlining-with-notenik.html" class="wiki-link">Outlining with Notenik</a> </li>
<li>Automatically Incrementing Sequence Numbers (this post) </li>
<li><a href="incrementing-an-existing-sequence-number.html" class="wiki-link">Incrementing an Existing Sequence Number</a> </li>
<li><a href="indentation-to-show-outline-levels.html" class="wiki-link">Indentation to Show Outline Levels</a> <hr />
</li>
</ol>

<p>Upon first consideration, having to manually wrangle sequence and level numbers in order to create an outline might seem unnecessarily difficult. </p>

<p>And so it would be, were it not for a number of convenient features that Notenik supplies specifically for working with outlines. </p>

<p>The first group of these helps by automatically incrementing sequence numbers. </p>

<p>This can work in three somewhat distinct ways. </p>

<p>First, if you position the current Note selection (using any of the views on the left of the Collection Window), and then request the addition of a New Note (which can be done most readily with the keyboard shortcut of CMD-N), you will see that your Seq value has been automatically incremented for you, and the Level value set to match the preceding Note — the one you initially selected. And so you can easily continue adding Notes to an outline without having to worry about Seq and Level numbers. Nifty! </p>

<p>Second, if you instead use the <code>New Note w/Options</code> item (just beneath the <code>New Note</code> item described above, towards the top of the <code>Note</code> menu, and easily accessible with a keyboard shortcut of OPT-CMD-N), you will see a little window allowing you to enter several fields at once. You can enter the Title of the Note, along with the Level and Seq fields. But here you will also see <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> keys that can be used to increment/decrement the Level value and — as you do so — the Seq field will be automatically adjusted to fit into the appropriate numbering sequence for the chosen Level! This can be super handy when you are adding Notes in sequence, but they are not all at the same level of indention. Click <code>OK</code> when you are done, and then your values will be pre-populated on the Edit tab for you. </p>

<p>And then, third, as a minor variation of the second option, if you click on the <code>Again</code> button instead of the <code>OK</code> button, you can skip the Edit tab, have Notenik add the Note for you —with just the fields you have entered in the <code>New Note with Options</code> window — and then immediately return to the <code>New Note with Options</code> window to add the next Note. This can be especially handy when you are trying to quickly capture the bare bones of an outline, with just Title fields and positions, leaving the possibility of fleshing out additional details later. </p>

<p>So there you have it! Three ways to have Notenik automatically increment your Seq values, without you having to manually enter any value other than the first! </p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned previously, Notenik supports <a href="lets-talk-metadata.html" class="wiki-link">metadata</a>. And different sorts of fields can be used for different purposes. </p>

<p>In many cases, you will want to sort the Notes in a Collection by some <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/field-labels-and-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">field</a> that contains data about the Note — something like Title or Author or Date, let&#8217;s say. </p>

<p>In other cases, though, you will want to impose some organizational sequence on a Collection of Notes based on the relationship between the Notes, or on some logical sequence that is not apparent from any of the metadata about the Note. </p>

<p>This is when you would want to use the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/seq.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seq</a> field. </p>

<p>A Seq field contains artificial values — values that you assign simply to get your Notes into whatever sequence is meaningful to you. </p>

<p>As you&#8217;re assigning such values, you will want to change the Sort sequences for your Collection to <code>Seq + Title</code>, or some other sort sequence making use of the Seq field, so you can see your Notes in the sequence you have assigned to them. </p>

<p>And then, to refine this approach a bit more, you can use the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/level.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Level</a> field to organize some Notes as being subordinate to others. </p>

<p>By combining these two fields — Seq and Level — you can structure your Notes into a hierarchy usually referred to as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outline</a>. </p>

<p>When fashioning an outline, you will generally want your Seq values to reflect your outline structure. That is, you will want your top level Notes to be numbered consecutively and then, within each parent item, you will want your children numbered consecutively, with a period (aka <em>dot</em> or <em>full stop</em>) separating each parent number from the numbering of its children. This numbering can be done recursively, to as many levels as you would like. </p>

<p>You&#8217;ll note that the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-knowledge-base.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik Knowledge Base</a> is structured in this fashion, using an outline. The Knowledge Base is one of several Notenik Collections stored within the <code>NotenikDocs</code> repo on GitHub. You can always download the repo from <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/NotenikDocs" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> if you&#8217;d like to inspect a working example of such an outline. </p>

<p>As it happens, Notenik seems to support Seq numbering in conformance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_2145" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISO 2145</a>. </p>

<p>Oh and by the way, feel free to use upper- or lower-case letters [a..z] instead of numbers, if you would like. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll share more Notenik outlining tips in future Adventures, but this should be enough to whet your appetite. </p>

							Formatting a Quote Attribution with Notenik 15.0.0
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 20 &bull;  Sunday, August 4, 2024</p>

					<p>The basic <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">syntax of Markdown</a> is easy to learn and invariant across many parsers &#8211; which explains the popularity of this writing tool in a nutshell. </p>

<p>At the same time, many people have created <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extensions</a> to the original tool as a means of solving many common problems, and many of these extensions have also been implemented consistently across a number of popular parsers. </p>

<p>And, of course, Notenik implements almost all of this. </p>

<p>But Notenik version 15.0.0 has just been released and, in addition to fixing a few bugs, this new release adds a new Markdown extension to solve a recurring problem that still seems to be outstanding. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the problem. </p>

<p>HTML offers the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockquote</a> tag to allow a quotation to be distinguished from surrounding text, and this tag can be easily styled with CSS. </p>

<p>And standard Markdown implements a <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handy convention for generating blockquotes</a>, so all is well here. </p>

<p>The problem arises when an author wants to provide a nicely formatted attribution line following the quotation, indicating its source. </p>

<p>Because here there is no special HTML tag nor any Markdown syntax to provide any help. </p>

<p>Nor is there any overall consensus on the best way to format such a commonly seen line, even when dropping down out of Markdown into HTML. </p>

<p>I like to include quotations in my writing on a regular basis, so I&#8217;ve been working aound this issue for some time now. </p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve finally created a new Markdown extension to help address this problem. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the simplest form of such an attribution: </p>

<pre><code>{:quote-from:George Bernard Shaw}
</code></pre>

<p>And here&#8217;s the way it would look, when expanded by Notenik, following the appropriate quotation. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You see things; and you say, &#8216;Why?&#8217; But I dream things that never were; and I say, &#8216;Why not?&#8217; </p>
</blockquote>

<p class="quote-from"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Bernard Shaw</a>, 1921, from the play <cite>Back to Methuselah</cite></p>

<p>Note that, in this case, I&#8217;ve included other information, in addition to the author&#8217;s name, so that the full Markdown would look like this: </p>

<pre><code>{:quote-from:George Bernard Shaw|1921|Play|Back to Methuselah|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw|}
</code></pre>

<p>All the details can be found in the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/format-a-quote-citation.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowledge Base</a>. </p>

<p>Notenik also provides some default CSS styling for both the <code>blockquote</code> tag, and for the <code>quote-from</code> class that is applied to the paragraph element enclosing the citation text, to make everything line up nicely, and to provide the leading em dash. But of course this can be overridden by the user for their particular application. </p>

<p>I hope others make use of this as much as I know I will! </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where all that hard work pays off, if you&#8217;re using Notenik. </p>
<ul>
<li>View all the entries in your book, sorted by the titles you have assigned to each entry. </li>

					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 18 &bull;  Monday, July 29, 2024</p>

					<p>Once you&#8217;ve <a href="commonplacing-with-notenik.html" class="wiki-link">committed to starting a commonplace book</a>, and then decided to store your book in <a href="storage-medium-for-a-commonplace-book.html" class="wiki-link">plain text files formatted with Markdown</a>, then the next question is: what data do you want to collect as part of each entry? </p>

<p>Many sites only provide a quotation along with an author. But then, many sites seem to make things up, or repeat things that have been heard elsewhere, even if they <a href="https://www.snopes.com/collections/albert-einstein-collection/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have no basis in fact</a>. </p>

<p>So I generally like to capture the year in which the quotation was first published or recorded, along with its original source. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikiquote</a> is often a good source for this information. But of course, if you&#8217;re capturing an entry as part of your own reading of a source, that additional data is already readily available. </p>

<p>And then, of course, you can try to categorize each entry as it is made. I&#8217;ve found this to be a very useful exercise, partially because it helps me to think more deeply about the import of each quotation. In Notenik, the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tags.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tags</a> field can be used for this purpose. Notenik allows multiple tags to be assigned to each entry, and also supports nested tags. You probably don&#8217;t want to go overboard with tagging, but I would certainly recommend some level as a way to make your growing collection both more interesting and more useful. </p>

<p>One additional consideration is whether you want your commonplace to be stored in a single collection, or in a series of related collections. For example, Notenik allows the user to create a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/commonplace-with-lookups.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commonplace with Lookups</a>, in which both Authors and their Works are stored in separate collections. The advantage of this sort of setup — especially if you want to collect additional info about authors, and about their works — is that such data then only needs to be entered once, and can then simply be referenced if you have multiple entries from the same author,  and/or from the same work. </p>

<p>Notenik offers a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/fields-useful-for-reviews-citations-and-quotations.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of different field types</a> that can be used as part of a commonplace book, whether you use lookups <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/commonplace-book.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or not</a>. </p>

<p>But then, what can you do with this additional data, once you start collecting it? Well, that will be the subject of our <a href="leveraging-commonplace-entries.html" class="wiki-link">next post</a>. </p>

					<p>Once you&#8217;ve committed to starting a commonplace book, your first question will be: how should I store it? </p>

<p>Upon first consideration, this may seem like an easy answer, since there are all sorts of available document formats and apps available that will hold words for you. </p>

<p>But consider that this is a collection of words that you may well want to continue growing for not just months, or years, but for decades — without ever having to lose everything and start over. </p>

<p>So you don&#8217;t want to store it using some sort of service or app that might suddenly go out of business, or decide to terminate the particular offering you are using. </p>

<p>You probably don&#8217;t want to use some format that will require a subscription that has to be paid regularly in order for you to continue to have access to your commonplace book. </p>

<p>And you probably don&#8217;t want to trust your collection to some esoteric data format that is not well supported by a number of different apps. </p>

<p>You do want a format that can be easily backed up. </p>

<p>You do want to be able to preserve the original formatting of each entry, along with any associated data that may be important to you (more on that later). </p>

<p>And, ideally, you want each individual entry to be separately addressable, so that it&#8217;s easily available for later reference and use, and so that your commonplace collection can be easily categorized, sorted and filtered in different ways. </p>

<p>And you want to be able to easily extract and make use of individual entries, and integrate them into other works, which may be in a variety of formats. </p>

<p>Once you take all of these points into consideration, I think the only rational way to store your commonplace book is: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plain text</a>, with the quotes formatted using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown</a>; </p></li>
<li><p>With each entry stored in its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text file</a>. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>And, of course, this is exactly how Notenik will store your commonplace book. </p>

							Commonplacing with Notenik
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 16 &bull;  Saturday, July 27, 2024</p>

					<p>As one reviewer on the US Mac App Store says, Notenik &#8220;is flexible enough to fit any number of use cases, from the simple to the complex.&#8221; </p>

<p>But certainly one of my core use cases for Notenik is storage of a commonplace book. </p>

<p>You can read more about commonplace books on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> but, if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the term, it can be most readily described as a collection of sayings or excerpts, maintained by an individual, with the items often collected under thematic headings. </p>

<p>And the NY Times has a nice &#8220;tech tip&#8221; from a couple of years ago talking about how to &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/personaltech/make-digital-commonplace-book.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a Digital Commonplace Book</a>.&#8221; </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping one for decades now &#8211; long before I became acquainted with the term &#8220;commonplace,&#8221; used in this way. And I had an older Mac App, written in Java, called <a href="https://macdownload.informer.com/iwisdom/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iWisdom</a>, that was designed specifically for this purpose. </p>

<p>Based on my own experience, my recommendation is for everyone to start and continue to maintain their own commonplace book, for all of the following reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>It encourages one to read — the most important way of expanding one&#8217;s knowledge and perspectives. </p></li>
<li><p>It makes one a more active and engaged reader. </p></li>
<li><p>It forces one to be selective, since the act of transcribing a quotation from its original source takes some time and effort, and is not worth doing for every bit of text one runs across. In other words, it encourages us to separate the wheat from the chaff. </p></li>
<li><p>The result is a continually growing record of what one has read, and a resource of words that have had some particular meaning for us. </p></li>
<li><p>The ability to refer back to such a collection has enduring value for thinkers and writers interested in organizing and distilling important ideas, and synthesizing new ones. </p></li>
<li><p>For all of us, as we mature, such a collection can serve as an important reminder of the words that have had meaning for us over the years, and an opportunity to reflect on the significance of these thoughts in our own lives. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;ll have more to say about &#8220;commonplacing with Notenik&#8221; in several follow-on posts, but this one will hopefully serve as an introduction to the series. </p>

					<p>I&#8217;ll tell you a little secret &#8211; even if no one else in the world was using Notenik, I would still continue to work on it, just because I want to use it. </p>

<p>If there were another Mac app out there that worked the way Notenik did, and did all the same things that Notenik does, then I would probably stop working on my little app, and switch to the other product. </p>

<p>But, to the best of my knowledge, there&#8217;s nothing else out there with quite the right combination of quirks and features to scratch my particular itch. </p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, though &#8211; it provides me with great satisfaction to develop software that others can use, and to see others discovering it and using it, and appreciating it for the same reasons I do &#8211; and even pointing out ways to make it better. </p>

<p>But it all starts with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating my own dog food</a>. </p>

							Let's Talk Metadata
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 17 &bull;  Thursday, July 18, 2024</p>

					<p>Let&#8217;s talk metadata for a minute. </p>

<p>In the beginning there was HTML. </p>

<p>And HTML begat Markdown. </p>

<p>And Markdown begat MultiMarkdown. </p>

<p>And MultiMarkdown made explicit provision for <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/blob/master/Documentation/MultiMarkdown%20User%27s%20Guide.md#metadata" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metadata</a>: additional fields carrying information about a Markdown document. </p>

<p>And then <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YAML front matter</a> came along, which was another way of specifying metadata for a Markdown document. </p>

<p>But Notenik has been supporting Markdown metadata for at least ten years, going back to the original version, written in Java. </p>

<p>In Notenik, we just call them <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/field-labels-and-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fields</a>. </p>

<p>All of these formats &#8211; MultiMarkdown, YAML front matter, and Notenik &#8211; are slightly different, and Notenik supports all three. But basically these are just three different, but very similar, ways of supporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name–value_pair" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">name-value pairs</a> within text files that also contain Markdown. </p>

<p>But there is a difference between Notenik&#8217;s use of metadata vs. the way this info is used in other apps. </p>

<p>In all cases, metadata supplies variables that can be used when formatting a Markdown document. </p>

<p>But with Notenik: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Each different collection of text files, stored in its own folder,  can have its own specific definition of the types and names of fields to be found within that collection; </p></li>
<li><p>The metadata is used, not just to format and identify documents, but as a means of <em>organizing</em> the files within a collection, so that the collection itself becomes an entity with its own characteristics. Add a date field, and then you can sort by date. Add an author field, and you can sort by author. Add a status field, and you can separate completed items from ones still in work. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Metadata is the basis of many of Notenik&#8217;s most powerful functions, so it&#8217;s good to get a handle on what it is and how it can be used. </p>

					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 13 &bull;  Wednesday, July 17, 2024</p>

					<p>I love the way Notenik manages to evolve gracefully over time. </p>

<p>At some point I added a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/streamlined-reading.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streamlined Reading</a> option for a Notenik Collection, which tried to make it easy to read the notes in a collection much as if they were the chapters in a book &#8211; partly by minimizing the display of detailed metadata. </p>

<p>Then later I added a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/presentation-mode.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Presentation mode</a>, which was also streamlined, but which did not reveal the title of the next note/slide before actually advancing to it. </p>

<p>And then later I added a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/quotations-mode.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quotations mode</a>, designed to display a collection of quotations in a highly readable fashion. </p>

<p>So at this point I decided to generalize this to a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tailor-collection-settings.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collection Display Mode setting</a>, supporting the selection of any of these modes. </p>

<p>And then I received a request to support an <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/optional-display-switch/410?u=hbowie" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optional Display Switch</a>, to allow a user to temporarily switch their display back to normal mode, when using a custom merge template to <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tailor-the-display.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tailor the display</a>. </p>

<p>And then&#8230; rather than adding yet another display switching mechanism, I simply added a Display mode of <code>Custom</code> that would be automatically set on the detection of a <code>display.html</code> merge template, but which would then allow the user to select the <code>Normal</code> display mode, and then re-select <code>Custom</code> whenever they wanted to return to their custom display. </p>

<p>It gives me great satisfaction to continue to address new enhancement opportunities, and find ways to gracefully integrate them into the code base and into the user experience. </p>

							Mac Menus
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 12 &bull;  Tuesday, July 16, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik is written in Swift using AppKit (aka Cocoa) which means that in general it has a very traditional Mac user interface. </p>

<p>One of the elements of a traditional Mac app that Notenik is happy to leverage is its menuing system. </p>

<p>Many of Notenik&#8217;s advanced features are available from its main menu, always available at the top of the screen when Notenik is active. </p>

<p>There are two particular features of Mac menus that I want to highlight today. </p>

<p>The first are keyboard shortcuts. You can find a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/keyboard-shortcuts.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of these</a> in the Knowledge Base. </p>

<p>Even more conveniently, though, you can see these right alongside, and just to the right, of the menu items to which they provide access.  So for actions that you use often, it&#8217;s good to look for an assigned keyboard shortcut, and then try to memorize it so that you can use it next time, without having to use your pointing device to find and select the item from the top of the screen. </p>

<p>The other handy main menu feature I&#8217;d like to highlight today is the <code>Search</code> box right at the top of the Help menu. If you&#8217;re not sure where to find a particular menu item, you can enter a search word or phrase here, and immediately see a list of menu items containing that search term. Enter additional text to further refine your search. Hover over a line in the search results to see where it can be found in the menu structure, and to see its keyboard shortcut, if there is one. Click on one of those items to select it. </p>

<p>This menu search feature offers another handy way to explore and leverage Notenik&#8217;s extensive main menu structure. </p>

<p>Keyboard shortcuts and menu search &#8211; two helpful macOS functions that are always available within Notenik when you need them. </p>

							Three Types of Merge Templates
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 11 &bull;  Monday, July 15, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik supports essentially three different types of <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merge Templates</a>. </p>

<p>And these three types are distinguished by the varying placements of the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/output-command.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output command</a>. </p>

<p>The first type is used to <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tailor-the-display.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tailor the display</a> of notes within Notenik itself, as they appear on the Display tab. In this case the merge template file must be named <code>display.html</code> and placed in the same folder as the Notes themselves. For this type of merge template, there should be no <code>output</code> command at all, since the output will be routed by Notenik to its own internal Display tab. </p>

<p>The second type of merge template is used to produce a list or index containing multiple occurrences of Notes. For this type, the <code>output</code> command is typically placed at the very beginning of the template file, and specifies a static output directory and file name. </p>

<p>The third type of merge template is used to produce one output file per input Note. For this type, the <code>output</code> command is placed after the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/nextrec-command.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nextrec command</a>, and the <code>output</code> file name contains one or more variable fields, so that each Note&#8217;s information will be placed in its own file. </p>

<p>The second and third types are typically both used when creating a website. </p>

							Use Merge Templates to Format Output
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 10 &bull;  Friday, July 12, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik uses <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merge Templates</a> to generate output text files (such as web pages using HTML and web feeds using RSS or JSON). </p>

<p>They are called Merge Templates because they merge field values from Note(s)s into some sort of structure provided by a template. </p>

<p>Each Merge Template contains essentially three sorts of things: </p>
<ul>
<li>Output Structure – This depends entirely on what the output is to be used for. </li>
<li>Field Labels – Drawing on fields available from the input. </li>
<li>Merge Commands &#8211; These provide guidance on how the input data should be processed. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the template can specify one or more modifiers to be applied to each field value, in order to ensure the data is formatted appropriately. </p>

<p>Merge Templates are one of Notenik&#8217;s most powerful features, because they allow you to easily format the data in your Notes into any output format that can be expressed within a text file.  HTML, XML, JSON, CSV, tab-delimited and plain text files can all be generated easily, whenever you like. </p>

					<p>It&#8217;s taken a few tries to get this working but from now on I believe all of the <em>Adventures with Notenik</em> blog posts (starting with this one!) should be automatically cross-posting to @notenik@mastodon.social. </p>

<p>So now, in addition to being able to keep up with the blog by subscribing to one of its web feeds, you can now follow <a href="https://mastodon.social/@notenik" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@notenik@mastodon.social</a> to see the daily posts. </p>

<p>Since Mastodon is a micro-blogging service, the full content of each post will not appear there, but only the title and the teaser, with a link back to the full post on <a href="https://notenik.app/adventure-summaries.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik.app</a>. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="https://ifttt.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFTTT</a> to do the cross-posting, following the approach outlined <a href="https://hyperborea.org/journal/2017/12/mastodon-ifttt/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

							How To Build A Website
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 8 &bull;  Wednesday, July 10, 2024</p>

					<p>I 've used Notenik to build several websites. Here are a few examples: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reasontorock.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reason to Rock</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://softdevbigideas.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Software Development Big Ideas</a> </li>

<li><a href="https://hbowie.net" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H. Bowie</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>And here&#8217;s a general workflow for building such sites, with indications of where Notenik can be used. </p>

<section id="section-for-1-identify-types-of-content">

<h3 id="1-identify-types-of-content">1. Identify Types of Content</h3>

<p>For any website, you will have one or more types of content. For a simple blog, for example, you will have blog posts. Where Notenik excels, though, is in building sites with more complex content types, and with multiple types. But you need to start out by identifying these. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-2-identify-organizational-schemes">

<h3 id="2-identify-organizational-schemes">2. Identify Organizational Schemes</h3>

<p>How will you present your content to site visitors? A blog typically shows the latest post, followed by more recent ones, plus some sort of archive access. Depending on your content type(s), different means of filtering and ordering your content may be appropriate. Figure out what makes the most sense for your site. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-3-identify-fields-for-each-content-type">

<h3 id="3-identify-fields-for-each-content-type">3. Identify Fields for each Content Type</h3>

<p>What information do you want to present? What sorts of data may benefit from separate handling? What fields will you need for filtering and sorting, based on your organizational schemes? </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-4-figure-out-where-to-store-everything">

<h3 id="4-figure-out-where-to-store-everything">4. Figure Out Where to Store Everything</h3>

<p>When building a website, I typically don&#8217;t use the default location of the iCloud Notenik folder, because I end up with many different folders that I need to access in a variety of ways. The Sites folder within your home folder (as a peer to your Documents folder) is the traditional location for website stuff. If it doesn&#8217;t already exist, then create it, and then create a subfolder for your site, and everything related to it. Then create a <code>content</code> folder. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-5-build-your-notenik-collections">

<h3 id="5-build-your-notenik-collections">5. Build Your Notenik Collections</h3>

<p>Now it&#8217;s time to build the Notenik Collections that will house your content. Typically you would want a separate Collection for each content type although, in some cases, it might be beneficial to house them all in one Collection, with a different <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/class.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Class</a> value for each different content type. If in doubt, though, start with a separate Collection for each content type. Place all of these Collections within the <code>content</code> folder you created above. </p>

<section id="section-for-6-implement-version-control">

<h3 id="6-implement-version-control">6. Implement Version Control</h3>

<p>I would typically use Git, and use Tower as my Git client. But once you start creating files within your site&#8217;s folder, you probably want to use some sort of version control, and start checking stuff in regularly. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-7-identify-your-web-page-layouts">

<h3 id="7-identify-your-web-page-layouts">7. Identify Your Web Page Layouts</h3>

<p>These would typically include: </p>
<ul>
<li>A page for each content type, showing one Note within that Collection </li>
<li>One or more index pages listing multiple instances of a particular content type </li>
<li>A home page for your site, with navigational links leading to the other pages </li>
</ul>

<p>Figure out what you want each page to look like. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-8-create-notenik-merge-templates">

<h3 id="8-create-notenik-merge-templates">8. Create Notenik Merge Templates</h3>

<p>Now create a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merge Template</a> for each page layout. These would contain HTML tags, as well as your Merge Commands and Merge Variables. You would create these with your trusty text editor. Typically I would place these in a folder named <code>templates</code>, within a folder named <code>factory</code>, which would be a peer to the <code>content</code> folder you created earlier. It is the templates that specify the names and location of the actual web pages being created. Typically I would put these in a folder called <code>web</code>, that would be a peer to my <code>content</code> and <code>factory</code> folders. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-9-create-and-run-notenik-scripts">

<h3 id="9-create-and-run-notenik-scripts">9. Create and Run Notenik Scripts</h3>

<p>Finally create and run your <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/script-files.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Script Files</a>. Your script files pull everything together, reading from your Collections, sorting and filtering those Notes, and then using your templates to generate actual web pages. I would put these into a <code>scripts</code> folder that would be a peer to your <code>templates</code> folder, and also within the <code>factory</code> folder. Your script files will typically contain many steps. I often use Notenik to create the first step, and then go back to my trusty text editor to create others, copying and pasting and tweaking as I go. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-10-test-and-tweak">

<h3 id="10-test-and-tweak">10. Test and Tweak</h3>

<p>In this phase you run your scripts and tweak your content and templates until you are happy with the results. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-11-upload-to-a-web-server">

<h3 id="11-upload-to-a-web-server">11. Upload to a Web Server</h3>

<p>When everything looks the way you would like, you will want to upload the web pages to your actual site that is resident on an actual web server. I use Transmit as my FTP client, and use A2 Hosting for my web server, but there are many other choices available. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-12-maintain-and-enhance">

<h3 id="12-maintain-and-enhance">12. Maintain and Enhance</h3>

<p>At any point after initial publication, can can add new content to your Collections, and tweak your templates, then rerun your scripts, then upload changes to your web server. Each time you run your scripts your entire site will be rebuilt. However script execution should happen in only a few seconds. </p>

						<a class="invisi-link" href="adventures/using-match-merge-logic-in-notenik.html"?>
							Using Match-Merge Logic in Notenik
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 7 &bull;  Tuesday, July 9, 2024</p>

					<p>Notenik has a powerful ability to apply match-merge logic to an imported data set. </p>

<p>This feature is currently available for tab-delimited, CSV (comma-separated values), and Notenik import formats. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/import-settings.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Import Settings</a> are the keys to making this work for you. </p>

<p>Three questions arise when performing a match-merge. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>What to do with additional fields? In other words, if the import data set has some fields not already present in the primary Collection (the one to be updated with the import data), how should Notenik handle these? And there are two possible answers. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore the additional fields. </li>
<li>Add the additional fields to the primary Collection. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What to do with additional rows/lines/record/notes? And there are three options here. </p>
<ul>
<li>Add – Add all the rows in the import file to the primary Collection. </li>
<li>Match and Add – Use the primary Collection&#8217;s definition of key fields (Title, by default) to try to match imported items with existing items: if a match is found, then use the imported data to update the existing Note to match; if no matching key is found, then add the imported item to the Collection. </li>
<li>Match Only – Use the matching logic and update matching Notes, but discard any additional input items that do not already have a match. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What to do with data from obtained from <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/lookup.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lookup fields</a> found in a Notenik Collection being imported? And there are two possible answers: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore the referenced data </li>
<li>Consolidate it, by treating the looked up field labels and values as if they were part of the imported collection. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>How might one use this match-merge feature? </p>

<p>I have one Collection I update on a monthly basis with the latest info available from a website. The website offers an option to download data in CSV format, so after downloading the file, I then import it into my Collection. In this case, I don&#8217;t want to add any additional fields, but do want to match and update my existing Notes. After the import, I&#8217;ve got the latest data in my Notenik Collection! </p>

<p>Something else I tried recently was importing my <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/commonplace-with-lookups.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commonplace with Lookups</a> collection of quotations into a new Collection that did not rely on Lookups (making it more portable). In this case I just created a new Collection of <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/basic-notes.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basic Notes</a>, and then performed the import, asking to add additional fields, to match and add the additional rows, and to consolidate lookups.  This one quick import then magically transformed my basic notes collection into a fully-populated Commonplace book without any dependencies on other Collections referenced via lookup fields. Pretty powerful! </p>

<p>One warning: since this operation modifies both the structure and content of an existing Collection, it&#8217;s probably good to make sure you have some kind of backup available before doing this, in case the results are not exactly what you expected. </p>

						<a class="invisi-link" href="adventures/notenik-201-video-now-available.html"?>
							Notenik 201 Video Now Available
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 6 &bull;  Monday, July 8, 2024</p>

					<p>My first Notenik video, which I called <em>Notenik 101</em>, has been out for a couple of years now. Some people seemed to find it useful, but it was a fair amount of work and, to be honest, not my favorite kind of labor. Also, I only do screencasts for Notenik, so I don&#8217;t do it often enough to ever feel like I know what I&#8217;m doing. </p>

<p>With all of that being said, I finally realized that I had stalled long enough, and it was time to do another one. </p>

<p>At 20 minutes, <em>Notenik 201</em> is twice as long as the first one, so there&#8217;s a bit more substance here than there was in the introductory video. This new video explains all of the different ways you can customize a Notenik collection by tailoring field labels and field types and type configurations, so it should prove useful, and seems a logical next step after the <em>101</em> content. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already had a few users view it and respond favorably, so hopefully, if it&#8217;s a topic of interest to you, you should find it worth watching. </p>

<p>You can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/Qy0hejViBHI?si=ceZPjBdEOpw2ZozH" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on YouTube</a>. </p>

<p>Here is an example of a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merge Template</a> one might use to generate a JSON feed. </p>

<p>Note also the <code>if</code> test near the end comparing the <code>datacount</code> variable to the <code>datamax</code> variable. These are both Merge Template <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/system-variables.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">System Variables</a> introduced in <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-14.8.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Version 14.8.0</a>. The JSON syntax requires a comma following an item in a series, but forbids a trailing comma after the last item. This test ensures conformity to this element of the specification. </p>

<p>One would then want to include a line such as the following within the <code>head</code> section of the HTML pages on your site. </p>

							Adding a Web Feed to Your Site
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 2 &bull;  Thursday, July 4, 2024</p>

					<p>If you have a website to which you regularly add content, then at some point you will probably want to add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web feed</a> to your site. </p>

<p>You can use a combination of Notenik&#8217;s <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/script-files.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Script files</a> and <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/merge-templates.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merge templates</a> to easily generate such web feeds, in any or all of the major formats. </p>

<p>Such feeds will typically have one entry for each recent post, starting with the latest, and then proceeding backwards. </p>

<p>You don&#8217;t want to include all your site&#8217;s content in your feed, though, going back to the beginning of time. </p>

<p>So typically you pick some reasonable number and cut off your feed generation once you reach that point. </p>

<p>Exactly what constitutes a reasonable number may vary somewhat depending on the nature of your site, and how often it is updated. </p>

<p>In general, though, 20 seems like a good place to start. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s always been possible to do this sort of counting with Notenik, but a new feature in <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-14.8.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Version 14.8.0</a> makes this even easier and more straightforward. </p>

<p>Now you can simply add a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/filter-module-parameters.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filter rule</a> that compares the new system variable <code>datacount</code> to the maximum number you have chosen. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what this would look like in your script file (with tabs separating the columns): </p>

<pre><code>filter	add	le	datacount	20

							Introduction
						</a>
					</h3>
					
					<p class="news-date">Adventure # 1 &bull;  Wednesday, July 3, 2024</p>

					<p>What do we mean by <em>adventure</em>? </p>

<p>My copy of the <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em> offers this definition: </p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>adventure</em>: daring and exciting activity calling for enterprise and enthusiasm </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started my career in software development by answering a classified ad in the Sunday <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, taking an aptitute test provided by IBM, learning the job of computer operator, teaching myself COBOL from a few training books lying around the computer room,  then writing a couple of useful programs. </p>

<p>When I responded to the ad and showed up in Century City for my interview, I was armed with a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in English and a handgun. (Actually I left the gun in the glovebox of my car; out of desperation, I had just started a job as a security guard, and an insurance company required me to carry a gun while manning my post.) </p>

<p>If this isn&#8217;t yet sounding like an adventure to you, then your understanding of the term must be different from mine! </p>

<p>Some of my favorite books growing up were from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Swift" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Swift</a> series, so it&#8217;s always been natural for me to associate invention with adventure. </p>

<p>And I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to count almost all of the software development I&#8217;ve done over the course of my career as invention; that is, I was often in the enviable position to be able to make stuff up and then see how it worked. </p>

<p>But after a couple of decades of professional software development, my degree in English was still hankering to be put to good use, so when HTML and the World Wide Web came along, I decided to do a bit of writing and then self-publish on the Web. I had no idea whether anyone would actually read any of my stuff, but <a href="https://www.reasontorock.com/closing/feedback.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few people seemed to like it pretty well</a>.  </p>

<p>Another adventure! </p>

<p>Almost from the beginning of my web writing, though, I began to design and code software that could help structure and publish an entire web site. </p>

<p>This work evolved into what is now known as Notenik, and I still use it for website construction. </p>

<p>But rather than develop an app that was purely a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">static site generator</a>, I opted to create a general-purpose tool that could additionally be used to do any or all of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a simple collection of notes; </li>
<li>Maintain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal wiki</a>; </li>
<li>Maintain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal knowledge base</a>; </li>
<li>Outline a set of thoughts and ideas, with the option of fleshing these out in place, eventually creating a longer, well-structured work; </li>
<li>Maintain and organizing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/personaltech/make-digital-commonplace-book.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital commonplace book</a>, containing ideas and quotations from others; </li>
<li>Store info in a custom set of fields, uniquely tailored for each different collection of notes; </li>
<li>Allow users to write using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown</a>, and then convert to HTML as needed; </li>
<li>Import. export, sort, filter and format almost any type of personal information, for almost any purpose. </li>
</ul>

<p>So exploring these many possiblities has been an adventure of its own, and one that is still ongoing! </p>

<p>But Notenik is also intended to foster a sense of adventure <em>for its users</em>. Because it&#8217;s such a flexible tool, with such an extensive (and still evolving) set of features, Notenik users also get to be inventors, first imagining what they might want to do with Notenik, and then assembling the relevant pieces in order to turn their dreams into reality.   </p>

<p>So my intent for <em>Adventures with Notenik</em> is to create a blog containing writings from myself and others, each one describing a particular little adventure with the software, focusing on the &#8220;enterprise and enthusiasm&#8221; going into each effort. </p>

<p>I envision these posts as being inspiring and suggestive, but not necessarily being comprehensive &#8220;how-to&#8221; pieces (although occasional links to relevant sections of the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-knowledge-base.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowledge Base</a> will no doubt be helpful). </p>

<p>So here&#8217;s our first post for the blog. </p>

<p>I look forward to writing more, and also to see what others come up with! </p>

<p>(BTW, <em>Adventures with Notenik</em> now replaces both the <em>News</em> and <em>Usage</em> sections of the website that were there before, if you&#8217;re keeping track.) </p>
