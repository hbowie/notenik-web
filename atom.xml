		  <p>Can Notenik have too many bells and whistles? </p>

<p>I certainly don&apos;t want to break things that users (myself included) have come to depend upon. And I don&apos;t want to make the basics any more complicated than they already are. And I don&apos;t want to create obscure options that get in the way of things that are more generally useful. </p>

<p>But, even given these constraints, I still find myself adding ever more options and capabilities to Notenik. </p>

<p>These last few releases (10.1.0, 10.2.0 and the just-released 10.3.0) provide a number of good examples. Not all of them will be your cup of tea, but hopefully at least one or two will tickle your fancy. </p>

<h3 id="parent-realms-gain-new-powers">Parent Realms Gain New Powers</h3>

<p>I find myself using Parent Realms more and more. If you&apos;re not familiar with this concept, it&apos;s a folder that acts as a container for one or more Notenik Collections. A number of new features pertain to these sorts of folders. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A new file named &apos;<code>- INFO-parent-realm.nnk</code>&apos; now gets stashed within a parent realm folder when it is opened as such, and this file is then able to retain the last window coordinates for the parent realm window, so that they can be restored the next time you open that realm. I find this just makes use of these sorts of folders so much more pleasant &#8211; they just appear where I expect them to be, and are sized as I would like them, so I can start using them right away. </p></li>
<li><p>Wiki links between Collections are now possible, and these especially make sense when you are linking back and forth between Collections stored in a common Parent Realm. If this is something that sounds interesting to you, then see the new <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/wiki-links-between-collections.html">Knowledge Base entry</a> for all the details. </p></li>
<li><p>BBEdit Project files now show up within a Parent Realm, so you can easily use a Parent Realm window to open your BBEdit project, at the same time you are opening one or more Notenik Collections within the realm. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changes-to-file-handling">Changes to File Handling</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>A contiguous range of Notes may now be deleted from a Collection in one fell swoop, by selecting the range on the <strong>List</strong> tab, then selecting the <strong>Delete Range</strong> option from the List tab contextual menu. </p></li>
<li><p>Deleted Notes are now moved to the Trash, rather than being completely deleted. </p></li>
<li><p>Modified Notes now modify existing files on disk, rather than deleting and re-adding files. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="merge-template-commands-variables-and-modifiers">Merge Template Commands, Variables and Modifiers</h3>

<p>Several fixes and enhancements were made in this area. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The new Merge Templates System Variable &apos;<code>display-css</code>&apos; can be used to embed the CSS used within Notenik to style the Display tab. This new system variable might be used to populate the style section within the head of an HTML template, or might be used to populate a stand-alone CSS file. </p></li>
<li><p>The <code>&amp;apos;output&amp;apos;</code> command may now be qualified with an <code>&amp;apos;ifnew</code>&apos; operand, to indicate that the output from the Merge Template will only be written if the file is new, to avoid overwriting an existing file. (This can be used in conjunction with the new &apos;<code>display-css</code>&apos; variable described above to initialize a CSS file, but then avoid re-initializing it after the user has modified it.) </p></li>
<li><p>A new variable modifier of &apos;<code>Z</code>&apos; provides a new and more flexible way to transform the tags in a <strong>Tags</strong> field into a series of links. </p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>summarize</strong> variable modifier now recognizes a semicolon as a desirable stopping point for a summary, in addition to a period. </p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>wiki-style links</strong> variable modifier was sometimes not working properly; this has been fixed. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>

<p>A few minor tweaks were made, and annoyances eliminated. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hard line breaks within paragraphs were sometimes causing the first word on a following line to run right up against the last word on the line above, without any intervening space. This has been corrected. </p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Query Output</strong> window size and location is now retained and restored from one usage to the next. </p></li>
<li><p>A potential citation numbering problem was corrected. This would only occur when you had a citation definition that was never referenced. </p></li>
<li><p>Files with extensions of &apos;<code>.svg</code>&apos; are now properly recognized as potential image files. </p></li>
<li><p>If the Notenik Markdown parser finds a reference link that is missing its corresponding definition, then Notenik will now skip generation of the anchor element altogether, rather than generating one with an empty <code>href</code> value, to avoid any possible confusion for a browser. </p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Minutes to Read</strong> calculation was adjusted to use a value of 225 words per minute, instead of 200. While there is no absolute &quot;right&quot; number here, 225 produces results that seem more in line with popular blogging platforms. </p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>List</strong> tab would sometimes show a duplicate entry after an update; this has been fixed. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>As usual, you can find more details in the <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/version-history.html">Notenik Knowledge Base</a>. </p>

		  <p>Well, the version-ometer has clicked over once again &#8211; as it tends to do every week or so with Notenik &#8211; and look where we&apos;ve landed: on the big 10.0.0! </p>

<p>All those zeros seem to call for some sort of reflection on how we got here, so let me offer a few highlights: </p>

<ul>
<li>Notenik started life way back in 2009, as a desktop app written in Java; </li>
<li>The rewrite as a native Mac app began early in 2019; </li>
<li>Version 1.1.0 of the Swift app was released to the world six months later; </li>
<li>Over the three years since then we&apos;ve had ninety new releases containing some significant functional improvements (that&apos;s an average of one bundle of enhancements about every two weeks). </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the software itself (released as open source on <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/notenik-swift">GitHub</a>, and available as a free download through the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984">Mac App Store</a>), Notenik has picked up some significant supporting resources along the way: </p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://notenik.app">Notenik.app</a> website; </li>
<li>The Knowledge Base, available <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/notenik-knowledge-base.html">on the web</a>, and within the app itself; </li>
<li>A <a href="https://youtu.be/JR0kpAUXM5E">Notenik 101</a> video with a brief intro to the app; </li>
<li>And, most recently, a new <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app">Discourse Community</a> dedicated to discussion of all things Notenik. </li>
</ul>

<p>And then, there are the appreciative users, who have given Notenik an average rating of 4.9 on the App Store, making comments like these: </p>

<p>&gt; My favorite app: I can&apos;t say enough good things about Notenik. </p>

<p>&gt; A hidden powerhouse, with loads of potential to become one of Mac OS&apos;s premier note taking applications. </p>

<p>&gt; Powerful, thoughtful note taking software, flexible enough to fit any number of use cases, from simple to complex. </p>

<p>In spite of all the progress, though, there always seems more to do. </p>

<p>Take the latest release, which focuses on scripting, featuring: </p>

<ul>
<li>Improved scripting documentation; </li>
<li>The ability to run a script as an export, specifying the output folder at execution time; </li>
<li>The ability to run a script with a macOS custom shortcut, using the Shortcuts app; </li>
<li>An enhancement to the recently added Query Builder, to show the query output within a Notenik window, instead of a web browser. </li>
</ul>

<p>And so the saga continues&hellip;. </p>

<p>Looking back on the past several years, what I&apos;m most pleased by is the consistent, organic growth of the app and its user base. The goal has never been to corner any markets, or to beat out the competition, but rather to supply a unique and useful Mac app that might find a home in the <code>Applications</code> folder of some appreciative users, and could continue to evolve in interesting and useful ways.   </p>

<p>So far I&apos;d say we&apos;re right on track. </p>

	  <title>Notenik 9.6.0 - Choose Your Edit Fonts</title>

	  <summary>
		  You can now choose your own font(s) used on the Edit tab, and can also set default values for any of the fields in your Collection. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>Notenik has long allowed users to make all sorts of adjustments to the appearance of their Notes on the <strong>Display</strong> tab, and has for some time permitted adjustment of font size on the <strong>Edit</strong> tab, but did not previously give the users any choices as to the <em>font</em> used on the <strong>Edit</strong> tab. It was the macOS standard fonts, or the highway. </p>

<p>Now that era is behind us, already shrinking in our rear view mirror. </p>

<p>Starting with 9.6.0, users have a new option at the bottom of the <strong>View</strong> menu, allowing users to <strong>Adjust Edit Fonts</strong>. Once this selection has been made, a new <strong>Edit Font Preferences</strong> window makes its appearance. </p>

<p>This window allows the user to select any font available on their local system, as well as choose a font size. </p>

<p>But wait&hellip; there&apos;s more! </p>

<p>Because there are really three different types of UI controls that show up on the <strong>Edit</strong> tab. </p>

<ul>
<li>Field Labels, telling you what sort of value comes next. </li>
<li>Code values (including Links), where you&apos;d generally prefer a monospaced font. </li>
<li>Text values, for everything other than Code and Links. </li>
</ul>

<p>And so Notenik now allows you to make separate adjustments for all three types of UI controls, as they appear on the <strong>Edit</strong> tab. </p>

<p>Not everyone wants or needs this level of user interface customization, of course, but this is one more case where Notenik tries to follow Alan Kay&apos;s famous dictum: </p>

<p>&gt; Simple things should be simple; complex things should be possible. </p>

<p>Of course this latest release includes a few more nice changes as well. </p>

<p>If you&apos;d like to set default values for one or more of your fields, but don&apos;t need the complexity that comes with the <strong>Class</strong> field type, you can now create a <code>defaults</code> class template, and specify any non-blank values you&apos;d like each new Note to start out with. </p>

<p>Then the <strong>Code</strong> field type has been enhanced to make sure that HTML code actually displays as code, and is not interpreted as HTML. </p>

<p>And then there&apos;s a new, quite handy, link beneath the <strong>Help</strong> menu to take you to the recently launched Notenik Community found at <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app">discourse.notenik.app</a>. </p>

<p>As usual, you can find more details in the Notenik Knowledge Base, but I would encourage you instead to make use of the new Notenik Community. All of the changes in the latest release have been posted in the <strong>Pipeline</strong> category, and tagged with the version number, so you read more about all of them at this link: <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/tags/c/pipeline/14/version-960">version-960</a>. </p>

<p>And, if you&apos;d like to see what&apos;s <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/tags/c/pipeline/14/in-work">coming up for the next release</a>, or make your own <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/c/feature-requests/8">feature requests</a> you can, of course, also do that in the new Notenik Community. </p>

	  <summary>
		  The big announcement this time is about the launch of a new Notenik community at discourse.notenik.app. But there&apos;s also info on an important bug fix and a few nice enhancements. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>This post announces some features and bug fixes new since 9.3.0 but, perhaps more importantly, announces the launch of a nascent Notenik Community Forum located at <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app">discourse.notenik.app</a>. </p>

<p>I&apos;m excited about this new opportunity to create more of a community around Notenik, and hope you will take a look, sign up for membership, and contribute a question, a bug report, an improvement suggestion, or anything else that may be on your mind concerning Notenik! </p>

<p>And now, with that announcement made, let&apos;s turn to the usual news of recent changes to the Notenik app. </p>

<p>First of all, a user reported a rather nasty bug that could cause data loss when trying to adjust the Edit font size. This has been fixed in 9.5.0, and so it is once again safe to make use of this handy feature (which can be found beneath the <code>View</code> menu). </p>

<p>The context for many of the other recent Notenik changes is really Notenik&apos;s ability to create Collections with complex sets of fields and field types and then to make good use of all this info. </p>

<p>For example, some improvements were made in 9.4.0 regarding the dragging and dropping of a Note from one Collection to another. In some cases involving two Collections with complex but somewhat different sets of fields, Notenik was sometimes pasting the value of one incoming field into more than one field of the new Note being created. This has been corrected to ensure that no more than one field in the new Note is populated from one field in the Note being imported or copied. </p>

<p>And then there were some improvements regarding the use of Combo Boxes &#8211; UI Controls that let a user type in a new text value or select from a list of previously entered values. First, the workings of combo boxes for fields of type <code>Lookup</code> were improved. And next, a new field type of <code>Combo</code> can be used to create a dynamic combo box for any field. Pretty handy! </p>

<p>And then a new field type of <code>Teaser</code> was added, allowing such a field to be assigned a different label (something like <code>Summary</code>, for example). And then there&apos;s a new Markdown extension making use of this new field type, pulling teaser values (whatever you call them) from the children of a Note into the parent Note&apos;s body display. </p>

<p>And then, finally, a new option has been added to the Note Selector function (invoked via CTRL-S) allowing the title of a selected Note to be inserted into a nicely formatted Markdown Include command, including the selected Note into the Note currently being edited. </p>

<p>And that rounds out the set of changes in this latest release. See the <a href="../knowledge-base/EPUB/html/version-history.html">Notenik Version History page</a> for additional details, with links to new and updated pages in the Notenik Knowledge Base. </p>

<p>Once again, though, I hope you&apos;ll find your way over to our new Notenik Community at <a href="https:discourse.notenik.app">discourse.notenik.app</a> and connect with someone or something you find there. There&apos;s always more to learn about Notenik, and more to share, and it&apos;s exciting that others can now take part in the dialogue. </p>

		  Expanded Note Selector to allow selection from other Collections; added an import option for a folder full of text files; modified the defaults for a new Level field to avoid values of zero; added a command to populate an app catalog; improved editing of the Status field. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>This latest version of Notenik includes a couple of significant new functions that you might find useful, along with some nice enhancements to existing functionality. </p>

<h3 id="link-to-a-note-in-a-second-collection">Link to a Note in a Second Collection</h3>

<p>The Note Selector (introduced in Version 8.8.0) allowed the user to quickly and easily select another Note and then perform one of a number of actions on it &#8211; including formatting a Wiki Link to reference that Note, ready for insertion into the body of the Note being edited. </p>

<p>However a Wiki Link can only link to another Note within the same Collection. </p>

<p>But one can construct something like a Wiki Link to another Note in a different Collection by using the Notenik Custom URL Scheme in combination with Collection Shortcuts. </p>

<p>So the Note Selector window now includes a Collection Shortcut field. It&apos;s initially blank, indicating that the current Collection is to be referenced. But you can use the dropdown to select a different Collection, and then perform similar/equivalent actions on a Note from the other Collection &#8211; effectively allowing you to link from a Note in one Collection to another Note in a second Collection. </p>

<p>Not everyone needs or wants this level of interconnectivity, but some users may find it extremely useful. </p>

<h3 id="populate-an-app-catalog-for-your-mac">Populate an App Catalog for your Mac</h3>

<p>The second new function can be found beneath the <code>File</code> menu, and is called <code>Populate App Catalog</code>. You can point this function at your local <code>Applications</code> folder on your Mac, and it will then extract information about all the apps found therein, and use that info to populate your frontmost Collection with information about your apps. This is not something that will appeal to everyone, but it is a way of maintaining a user-editable, taggable, searchable, info repository about the applications that you use on your Mac. </p>

<h3 id="import-a-folder-of-text-files">Import a Folder of Text Files</h3>

<p>Also included is a new Import option that will allow you to import a folder full of existing text files in just about any format. (You could import one at a time previously, or drag and drop a bunch onto the List tab, but this new Import option may be easier to use in some cases.) </p>

<h3 id="improved-status-field-editing">Improved Status Field Editing</h3>

<p>Version 8.5.0 opened up the Status field to allow input that did not match any of the preset values, but also left a few problems behind. The Status field now combines the best of both worlds, allowing easy selection from a list of tailorable presets, or from any free-form status values encountered within the open Collection. </p>

<h3 id="additional-info">Additional Info</h3>

<p>And that rounds out the set of changes in this latest release. As always, if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>

<p>See the <a href="../knowledge-base/EPUB/html/version-history.html">Notenik Version History page</a> for additional details, with links to new and updated pages in the Notenik Knowledge Base. </p>

	  <summary>
		  Added a new model Collection &#8211; a Commonplace Book using Lookup fields &#8211; that can be used to initialize a new Collection; added automatic generation of initial backlinks when adding a Backlinks field; straightened out some issues that could affect capture of metadata when importing/pasting a new Note into a Collection; fixed some problems associated with moving/copying a Collection, including initial population of a new Collection.  <br />

	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>One of the things that Notenik can be used for is the creation and maintenance of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/personaltech/make-digital-commonplace-book.html">Digital Commonplace Book</a>. In fact, this was one of my original intentions motivating the creation of Notenik, and I&apos;ve been using my software to maintain my own Commonplace Book for quite a number of years (going all the way back to <a href="https://iwisdom.en.softonic.com/mac">iWisdom</a>, as a matter of fact). </p>

<p>Using software to create a list of notable quotations is easy enough, but it gets a little more challenging when you want to record associated information about the author of each quote, and the work from which the quote was taken. At some point, you begin to see that you need something like a relational database, with a separate table for authors, and another for works (books, etc.), and finally one for quotes, that can reference the other two. </p>

<p>As it turns out, all of this can be done using Notenik, taking advantage of the Lookup field type. But setting all of this up can be a bit daunting, requiring use of an external text editor to customize your Collection template files in various ways. </p>

<p>It all became a bit easier with the latest release, though. Now, when creating a new Collection, you can select an option of <code>Commonplace with Lookups</code> as a model Collection with which to initialize your own, and all of this will get set up for you automatically.  </p>

<p>See the <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/create-a-commonplace-book-with-lookup-fields.html">Create a Commonplace Book with Lookup Fields</a> article for more info on how all of this works. </p>

<p>And if you&apos;re wanting to see an example of how to use Lookup fields, perhaps with some different intent, this is still a great place to start. </p>

<p>One of the things I did here &#8211; which I had never done before &#8211; was to <em>nest</em> Notenik Collections, putting one Collection folder inside of another. To tell the truth, I wasn&apos;t even sure that this would work! But it all seems to work seamlessly, and helps to keep things straight. </p>

<p>Copying the model data from a secure location within the Notenik app bundle to the user&apos;s desired location, though, didn&apos;t initially work so well. So Notenik&apos;s ability to move or copy a Collection has been enhanced/corrected with this release, as well. </p>

<p>And then there was a problem with capturing metadata from an external text file when it got dragged into Notenik &#8211; so that&apos;s been fixed also. </p>

<p>And then, even though the Collection Preferences screen would let a user add a Backlinks field to an existing Collection, Notenik didn&apos;t automatically generate the initial set of Backlinks as part of that process. So that&apos;s been fixed up in this release as well. </p>

<p>And that rounds out the set of changes in this latest release. As always, if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>

		  Added import option for a single text file (or simply drag and drop from the Finder); modified Discard of Edits to use a less common keyboard shortcut (Shift-CMD-D) and to provide a confirmation alert before proceeding; added a new Markdown command to produce a simple Tags Cloud; and added an option to remove all previously assigned tags based on level.

		  <p>The latest release focused on smoothing out a few rough spots. </p>

<p>First, even though Notenik has gotten much more friendly of late in terms of working with text files in a variety of formats (YAML front matter, MultiMarkdown metadata, plain old Markdown, etc.), it was pointed out to me that there was not yet an easy and intuitive way to add a single existing text file to a Collection. So there is now an additional File Import option to import a single text file (in pretty much any format). Even easier, you can start in the Finder and drag such a file onto the List tab of any open Collection in order to add the Note to that Collection.  </p>

<p>Next there is the matter of the command to Discard Edits for a Note currently being entered. This is not an option that was ever meant to be used all that often &#8211; you only need it when you&apos;ve already entered some stuff, and just want to throw away your edits and start over &#8211; and yet it was all too easy to invoke this command unintentionally, and lose some of your work. So two changes were made: first, the keyboard shortcut is no longer just CMD-D, but now Shift-CMD-D; second, an alert now pops up when you enter this command, asking if you are sure you want to throw away any in-flight changes. These changes should help prevent any accidental data loss. </p>

<p>And then a couple of bugs were fixed that prevented use of an Author Lookup field. This should once again be working as intended. </p>

<p>If you&apos;re using the Level field to structure your Notes into a sort of outline, then a command had previously been provided to add special Tags entries reflecting this outline structure. But what if you decided you just wanted to get rid of all such Tags? There was no easy way to do so previously &#8211; but now there is. </p>

<p>And then there&apos;s a new Markdown command to create a sort of Tags Cloud based on the Tags you have entered for a Collection. This is an alternative to use of the existing command to create a Tags Outline. If you have multi-level tags on a Collection, then the Outline will probably be the best way to allow easy navigation. But if you&apos;re using a bunch of single-level Tags, then the new Tags Cloud format may be preferable. </p>

<p>So that&apos;s it for the latest updates! As always, if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>

		  The last couple of releases focused on better integration with other apps, including new Custom URL commands, new custom AppleScript commands, and the ability to integrate with the Hook app via their official scripts.  <br />

		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>The last couple of releases focused on integration with the <a href="https://hookproductivity.com">Hook app</a>. I&apos;ve had people ask me about Hook integration for a while now, and I finally invested enough time and energy to figure out how all of this might work. <a href="https://twitter.com/luccogzest">Luc Beaudoin</a> and his team were very helpful and responsive when I had questions, with the happy result that they have just today <a href="https://discourse.hookproductivity.com/t/integration-with-notenik-note-taking-app/4889/3">announced the availability of their integration scripts for Notenik</a>. It&apos;s been a pleasure working with the team, and it&apos;s nice to see one more user requested fulfilled. </p>

<p>There were some other enhancements as part of 8.9.0, 9.0.0 and 9.0.1 &#8211; generally along this same theme of integration. A couple of new commands were added to the custom URL scheme, to make it possible to access a Note via a complete file path as well as via its Timestamp. Hook integration was enabled via the addition of some new custom AppleScript commands. Also, you can now drag a text file onto Notenik&apos;s app icon, and Notenik will attempt to open the enclosing folder as a Collection, and then select the dropped Note. </p>

<p>Also corrected a problem with Notenik&apos;s Markdown parser that affected a list of numbers, one per line, without any spacing or punctuation. And also added a Collection pref to allow the Notenik parser to turn straight apostrophes into curly ones. </p>

<p>Oh, and when you hit the tab key while in a Link field, Notenik will now advance you to the next field, as one might expect, instead of actually inserting a tab character into the middle of a hyperlink. </p>

<p>And there&apos;s also a new addition to the Notenik documentation. Articles such as <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/obsidian-vs-roam/">this one from The Sweet Setup</a> go into quite a bit of detail comparing various players in the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) space, so I thought it might be time to offer up a description of Notenik features that is equally detailed, without being as lengthy and comprehensive as the Notenik Knowledge Base. The result is a new guide to Notenik&apos;s features, formatted in a way that makes it easy to compare to some of these other apps. You can find it <a href="https://notenik.app/features/EPUB/html/notenik-features.html">here</a> on the website. Feel free to check it out, and recommend it to others.  </p>

<p>So that&apos;s it for the latest updates! As always, if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>

	  <title>Notenik 8.8.0 - Improvements to Note Editing</title>

		  Added a Note Selector window that allows a user, while remaining on Display or Edit of one Note, to look up the title of a second Note, for possible insertion into the text of the first Note; also expanded the width of the Body text editing field, and made inclusion of a &apos;Body:&apos; field label optional, on the Edit tab as well as the Display tab. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>In other comparable note-taking apps, a common feature is to allow the user to easily select a second Note to become the target of a wiki-style link in a Note being edited. This has been sort of a &quot;missing feature&quot; in Notenik for a while now &#8211; but has finally shown up in this latest release. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the way it works. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hit the keyboard shortcut of CTRL-S. Note that you can do this at any time &#8211; whether you are in Edit mode or Display mode. If you are in Edit mode, then you will remain in Edit mode. </p></li>
<li><p>Watch the &apos;Note Selector&apos; window appear. </p></li>
<li><p>Type 3 or more letters in the text field at the top of the new window. After typing the third letter, you will see a list of all Notes in the Collection whose titles contain that sequence of characters anywhere within. Case (upper- or lower-) is not significant for this operation. </p></li>
<li><p>Select the row containing the title of the Note you are looking for. You can do this in one of several ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>Keep typing letters until the Note of interest is first in the list; </li>
<li>Use the down (and up, if you go too far) arrow keys to position yourself on the Note of interest; </li>
<li>Use your pointing device to click on the Note of interest. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Select your desired action from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the window. </p></li>
<li><p>Hit the OK button to take the indicated action with the selected Note. </p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, use a keyboard shortcut to combine steps 5 and 6. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here&apos;s the list of available actions, with their associated keyboard shortcuts. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>Copy Title</code> &#8211; Simply copy the selected Title to the System clipboard, ready to be pasted anywhere else you would like it to appear. (<code>CMD-C</code>) </p></li>
<li><p><code>Copy and Paste Title</code> &#8211; This action will copy the selected value to the clipboard, as above, but then will also attempt to paste that value into whatever text field you are currently editing. (<code>CMD-V</code>) </p></li>
<li><p><code>Copy Wikilink</code> &#8211; This action will copy the selected value to the clipboard, as above, but will enclose the value within double brackets, in order to form a wikilink. (<code>OPT-CMD-C</code>) </p></li>
<li><p><code>Copy and Paste Wikilink</code> &#8211; This action will copy the selected value to the clipboard, as above, but will enclose the value within double brackets, and then paste the resulting wikilink into whatever text field you are currently editing. (<code>OPT-CMD-V</code>) </p></li>
<li><p><code>Go To</code> &#8211; Navigate to the selected Note. (<code>CMD-G</code>) </p></li>
<li><p><code>Launch Link</code> &#8211; Launch the Link field of the selected Note. (<code>CMD-L</code>) </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that, so long as the Note Selector window is still frontmost, the keyboard shortcuts indicated above will override their usual meanings within the application. </p>

<p>Also note that you can add other modifier keys if that will help avoid invocation of some app other than Notenik: for example, SHIFT-OPT-CMD-V will work as well as OPT-CMD-V, to copy and paste the selected title as a wikilink. </p>

<p>So now, if you&apos;re editing the body of a Note, and want to add a wiki link to a second Note, you can insert a perfectly formatted wikilink with just a few strokes on your keyboard. </p>

<p>Of course, as indicated by the action list above, you can perform other tasks as well, but insertion of wikilinks is the requested feature that has been missing until now. </p>

<p>Oh, and let&apos;s see &#8211; there are a couple of other new things to mention as well. </p>

<p>First, I created a litte more space for body text on the Edit tab. The Edit tab is split into two columns, with field labels on the left, and with values on the right. This arrangement generally works well, especially for fields with compact values, but makes less sense for the body of the Note itself, especially if the text is of any significant length. So the field for the body value now appears below any label field, and spreads out over both columns, allowing more room for text entry. Additionally, if the user has turned off the Collection Preferences option to include an explicit body field label, then the Body label will also be excluded on the Edit tab &#8211; again providing more space for entry of body text. </p>

<p>Next, there&apos;s a new document available on the website: &quot;<a href="../how-notenik-stacks-up-against-the-big-names.html">How Notenik Stacks Up Against the Big Names</a>&quot;. My intent here was to lay out various features of Notenik in a way that would make it easy to compare Notenik to other better-known apps in the Zettelkasten/Personal Knowledge Management space. If you think I&apos;ve missed something here, then please let me know! </p>

<p>So that&apos;s it for the latest release! As always, if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>

	  <title>Notenik 8.7.0 - A Chocolate and Vanilla Swirl</title>

		  Mix a dark appearance in Notenik with a light System appearance; use Notenik as a project launcher, leveraging the versatility of Notenik&apos;s Link field; and further refine the appearance of a Web Book. It&apos;s all here in the latest release. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>Henry Ford once remarked that a customer could have &quot;any color so long as it was black&quot;. Apple had a similar policy with the Mac interface for many years, telling customers that they could have any appearance so long as it was black text on a white background, which they dubbed &quot;light&quot;. </p>

<p>Apple doubled users&apos; options a few years ago when they added a General Appearance preference to allow them to choose either dark (white text on a black background) or light. </p>

<p>And Notenik added an option a little while back to follow the System Preference, so that when the System pref is light, Notenik will be light, and when the System pref is dark, so shall Notenik be dark. </p>

<p>But some people like to mix and match their light and dark, just as some like to swirl their chocolate and vanilla in their cones, and so the latest release of Notenik has its own App preference to set its appearance to either light or dark &#8211; no matter what the rest of the system is doing.  </p>

<p>So if you like Notenik in dark mode &#8211; but want to keep the rest of the system a bit lighter in appearance &#8211; you can now choose that option. </p>

<p>A few other options in this release help a bit with nicely formatting a Web Book. You can see the results on a new website I&apos;m working on. The site is <a href="https://keylists.org">here</a>, and all of the source files are <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/key-lists">here</a>. One of the enhancements allows the creation of a <a href="https://keylists.org/lists-by-tag.html">tags outline</a> without having to include untagged Notes. The other enhancement allows finer control of Seq formatting for differing numbering levels. On my new site, for example, the <a href="https://keylists.org/key-lists.html">lists themselves</a>, at the top level of numbering, are not showing their Seq numbers at all. Once you dive down a level, though, the items within each list are <a href="https://keylists.org/motivational-factors-for-complex-work.html">showing their numbers</a>. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve also added an article in the Knowledge Base describing how Notenik can be used as a <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/make-a-project-launcher.html">project launcher</a>, and that takes advantage of some other enhancements appearing in this latest release. Notenik&apos;s logic for handling folders has been refined a bit, to more usefully distinguish between different types (packages, etc.). And a new command has been added beneath the <code>File</code> menu to <code>Grant Folder Access</code>, in case you want Notes in one Collection to be able to open files and folders located somewhere else. Also, you can now Launch Links from the Tags tab, as well as the List tab, and you can launch Links from multiple selected Notes all at once, again from either of these tabs. </p>

<p>So that&apos;s it for the latest release! As always, if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>
