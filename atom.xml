		  Version 7.2.0 of Notenik includes a handful of nifty changes: the website address has been updated to point to Notenik.app; wiki links now will try to pluralize a reference, if it is not found in singular form; the Merge template Set command now allows a variable to be used as part or all of a global variable name; Markdown quote sharing corrected to respect lookup links; added a Quick Export and Open command.

		  <p>Version 7.2.0 of Notenik includes a handful of nifty changes. </p>
<h4 id="new-and-improved-notenik-website">New and Improved Notenik Website</h4>
<p>The Notenik website used to reside at Notenik.net. </p>
<p>That URL will still get you there (as will Notenik.com), but the primary name for the website has now been changed to <a href="https://notenik.app/">Notenik.app</a> because &#8211; well it&apos;s all about the Notenik App! </p>
<p>More significantly, the appearance and the contents of the site have both been improved. Check it out when you get a chance! </p>
<p>And, for those of you who are interested, the Notenik site is itself generated by a Notenik collection. You can see all the files that make it happen on GitHub, at <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/notenik-web">github.com/hbowie/notenik-web</a>. </p>
<h4 id="wiki-links-now-attempt-pluralization">Wiki Links Now Attempt Pluralization</h4>
<p>Since it is often tempting to title a Note using the plural form of a word &#8211; but also common to want to refer to that Note using the singular form &#8211; if a <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/wiki-style-links.html">wiki-style link</a> does not immediately find its target, an &apos;s&apos; will be added to the link internally, and the resulting Note will be used as the target, if such a Note exists. </p>
<h4 id="markdown-quote-sharing-now-respects-work-title-lookup">Markdown Quote Sharing Now Respects Work Title Lookup</h4>
<p>One of the options for sharing a Note is to format a quote in Markdown. But I noticed recently, after updating my Commonplace Book to look up work and author information in separate Collections, that not all of the information about the author&apos;s work was being included. This has now been fixed. </p>
<h4 id="added-quick-export-and-open-command">Added Quick Export and Open Command</h4>
<p>There&apos;s a new command at the bottom of the <code>File</code> menu to perform a <code>Quick Export and Open</code>. This command will execute immediately, and perform the following sequence of actions. </p>
<ol>
<li>Export the current Collection in comma-separated values format; </li>
<li>Automatically name the output file <code>export.csv</code>; </li>
<li>Automatically place the output file in a Collection subfolder named <code>quick-export</code>; </li>
<li>Ask the operating system to open the resulting output file using whatever application is your standard for editing <code>.csv</code> files (for me, this is Apple&apos;s Numbers app). </li>
</ol>
<p>This command gives you a quick and easy way to view your Collection in the traditional rows-and-columns view associated with spreadsheets. </p>
<h4 id="object-of-a-merge-template-set-command-can-now-include-a-variable">Object of a Merge Template Set Command can now include a Variable</h4>
<p>One of the things I wanted to do when building the new Notenik.app site was to highlight the active link in the Navigation Bar. Normally this would mean that you would have to use JavaScript to modify the styling of the Nav Bar, depending on which page you were on, or would have to customize the coding of the Nav Bar for each different page on the site. But I didn&apos;t really want to do either of those things. </p>
<p>My Nav Bars (primary on top, secondary below) are coded in a couple of include files, so that I can pull them into each page as it is built. But then I needed to vary the CSS class specified for each item, depending on which page I was building. I could use a different global variable for each item, and then set the active one to a different class, in order to highlight it. It turns out (I had to check the code to verify) that a global variable specified in a primary file will be passed into include files, so that they can be referenced there. But then, how to set the global variables in a neat way, with a minimum amount of code? </p>
<p>Here&apos;s what I came up with, for inclusion in the content template file. </p>
<pre>
<code>&amp;lt;?set index-class = another-page ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?set links-class = another-page ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?set news-class = another-page ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?set docs-class = another-page ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?set about-class = another-page ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?set connect-class = another-page ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?set license-class = another-page ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?set privacy-class = another-page ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?set support-class = another-page ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?set =$title$=-class = current-page ?&amp;gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Do you see what I&apos;m doing there? I first set the class for each nav item to its default value. </p>
<p>And then, with that last set command, I use the <code>title</code> variable &#8211; within the name of the global variable being set! &#8211; to change the appropriate class variable to the name of the class to use for highlighting. </p>
<p>It&apos;s kind of a neat solution. But it wouldn&apos;t have worked with earlier versions of Notenik, because the object of the set command &#8211; the name of the global variable to be set &#8211; couldn&apos;t include a variable! </p>
<p>But now it can! </p>
<h4 id="enjoy">Enjoy!</h4>

	  <title>Notenik 7.1.0 - Taking Dark Mode All the Way</title>

		  Notenik has mostly supported Dark Mode from the beginning &#8211; everywhere except on the Display tab, where the default was still to show black text on a white background. Now the Display Tab will follow your light/dark preferences, along with the rest of the App. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <h4 id="turning-to-the-dark-side-on-the-display-tab">Turning to the Dark Side on the Display Tab</h4>
<p>I was kind of a late adopter of the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-a-light-or-dark-appearance-mchl52e1c2d2/mac">Dark Appearance Setting on the Mac</a>. </p>
<p>At first I just didn&apos;t see the point. </p>
<p>But I kept trying it out until it started to grow on me a bit. </p>
<p>Until now I&apos;m using it all the time, and turning on the light setting now seems a bit of a shock. </p>
<p>Notenik has mostly supported Dark Mode from the beginning &#8211; everywhere except on the Display tab, where the default was still to show black text on a white background. </p>
<p>The reason for this was a little bit complex. I&apos;m using the Mac&apos;s WebKit API to format the Display tab, which means I&apos;m essentially formatting each Note display as a Web page &#8211; and I hadn&apos;t yet incorporated the latest HTML to allow the page to follow the user&apos;s wishes in terms of the light/dark setting. </p>
<p>But Notenik 7.1.0 fixes all that. As a bonus, when you use one of Notenik&apos;s functions to generate an actual Web page from a single Note or a Collection, the generated pages will also include the code to respect the user&apos;s preferences. </p>
<p>I think the results look pretty sharp, if I do say so myself. </p>
<p>(Of course, you can still supply your own CSS if you&apos;d prefer different colors.) </p>
<h4 id="highlighting-search-text-matches">Highlighting Search Text Matches</h4>
<p>Another new feature in 7.1.0 that also shows up on the Display tab is highlighting of matching text when you execute a Search function. Previously Notenik would take you to the Note(s) containing the text you were searching for, but would not show you where the text was found. For a brief Note, this wasn&apos;t usually a problem, but for longer Notes, it could be a bit frustrating to try to figure out where the matching text had been found. With 7.1.0, the matching text will be clearly highlighted. </p>
<h4 id="generating-wikipedia-links">Generating Wikipedia Links</h4>
<p>The final little goodie in this release is the ability to automatically populate a Link field by taking the Title of a Note and then transforming it into a Link to the English Wikipedia page on that topic. Not everyone will find this feature useful, but if you have a Collection of your favorite Authors, for example, it can be handy for populating a Link field for each author. You can find this new function within the Note menu, about halfway down the list. </p>
<h4 id="enjoy">Enjoy!</h4>
<p>Hope you enjoy the new release! If you have questions or problems or suggestions for further improvements, just send me an email at <a href="mailto:hbowie@notenik.app">hbowie@notenik.app</a>, and I&apos;ll get back to you as quickly as I can. </p>

	  <summary>
		  Added several new options to better support outlining: OPML Export, ability to add a new Child to an existing Note, plus ability to drag and drop within a sequenced list; fixed list scrolling so that the Note highlighted and visible on the left will generally match the Note currently selected on the right. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <h4 id="added-opml-import-function">Added OPML Import Function</h4>
<p>An OPML Outline file can now be imported into Notenik. See <a href="../knowledge-base/EPUB/html/assemble-an-outline.html">Assemble an Outline</a> for more info. </p>
<h4 id="enhanced-opml-export-function">Enhanced OPML Export Function</h4>
<p>The export will now nest <code>outline</code> elements based on <a href="../knowledge-base/EPUB/html/level.html">Level</a> field values. </p>
<h4 id="added-aposnew-childapos-option-to-list-tab-popup-menu">Added &apos;New Child&apos; Option to List tab Popup Menu</h4>
<p>When using the Seq and Level fields, added an option to the Notes List popup menu to add a New Child to an existing Note, so that the Level field will be incremented by 1, and the Seq value will have a <code>.1</code> added to it. </p>
<h4 id="added-ability-to-drag-and-drop-within-a-sequenced-list">Added Ability to Drag and Drop Within a Sequenced List</h4>
<p>If you have a Sequenced Collection, you can perform some basic resequencing by dragging and dropping a Note from one position to another on the List tab. Note that you must move the Drop indicator to a line above and/or below existing Notes in order to indicate a desired new position for an existing Note. Only the Note being dragged and dropped will have its Seq value changed. </p>
<h4 id="improved-list-scrolling">Improved List Scrolling</h4>
<p>In most cases, the list view on the left should now scroll to show the selected Note displayed on the right. </p>

<p>As part of the Collection Preferences, a user may now check a box to Format Display for Streamlined Reading. </p>
<p>Checking this option will cause the Display tab to focus on the Body of each Note, while minimizing the appearance of metadata. The net effect &#8211; especially if one declines to Include an Explicity Body Field Label on the Display tab &#8211; is to make it easier for a user to focus on the content of each Note. </p>
<h4 id="added-markdown-support-for-definition-lists">Added Markdown Support for Definition Lists</h4>
<p>Markdown definition lists are now supported by the standard Notenik parser. </p>

		  Updated the Work List field type to allow entries for &apos;Novel&apos; and &apos;Podcast&apos; (and to make it easier to enter using all lowercase letters); added a new field type of Level, to indicate the depth of a Note within the structure of a Collection; added a new command to renumber the Seq field based on sequence and Level; added a new command to generate tags that will mirror the outline structure implied by the combination of Seq and Level fields.

		  <h4 id="added-level-as-new-field-label-and-type">Added Level as New Field Label and Type</h4>
<p><code>Level</code> has been added as a new field label and type. A field of this type can be used to indicate the level of a Note within the overall structure of the Collection &#8211; which can be used, along with the Seq field, to define an outline. </p>
<h4 id="added-new-collection-command-to-replace-tags-based-on-seq-and-level">Added New Collection Command to Replace Tags based on Seq and Level</h4>
<p>This new command automatically adds tags to reflect the outline structure created by combining Seq and Level. </p>
<h4 id="added-collection-command-to-renumber-seq-based-on-level">Added Collection Command to Renumber Seq Based on Level</h4>
<p>Now that we have a Level field, we can combine Level with Seq to create an outline structure, and then, with this change, can automatically renumber the Seq fields in a Collection to reflect that outline structure. </p>
<h4 id="updates-to-work-list-field-type">Updates to Work List Field Type</h4>
<p>I added &apos;Novel&apos; and &apos;Podcast&apos; as new choices, when specifying the type of work being referenced or quoted. </p>
<p>I also modified the logic so that you can use either a leading lower-case letter, or leading upper-case, when entering a work type value. Whichever one is used, and chosen, the value stored will be with leading upper-case. </p>
