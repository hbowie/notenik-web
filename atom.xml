		  Our first Notenik video, a new collection of brief Notenik Tips, the ability to jump to a random note in a collection, recall of Collection window sizes and positions, and a few more MathJax fixes &#8211; it&apos;s all part of the lastest Notenik release! 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>Notenik 8.3.0 is out today, and there have been a variety of improvements made since the 8.2.0 release. </p>
<p>First, even though this is not technically part of the software itself, I want to take this opportunity to announce the availability of the first video about the app, titled &quot;Notenik 101.&quot; It&apos;s available on <a href="https://youtu.be/JR0kpAUXM5E">YouTube</a>, and it&apos;s about a 10-minute introduction to use of the app. Please share liberally, if you know of others who might be interested in a brief video tour demonstrating the software. </p>
<p>Next, the new release now contains a number of brief tips about Notenik usage. These are &#8211; of course &#8211; housed in their own Collection. This read-only Collection will open automatically each time you launch Notenik &#8211; at least, that is, until you turn this behavior off in the Notenik Preferences. You can also open it later from a new entry under the Help menu. Even if you&apos;ve been using Notenik for a while now, you might find one or two nuggets here that you hadn&apos;t previously known about. </p>
<p>This release contains a few other enhancements that are used by the Notenik Tips Collection. You&apos;ll notice that these Tips open in Streamlined Reading mode, which means that, at the bottom of each Note&apos;s display, you&apos;ll see a link to take you to the next Note. But what happens when you reach the last Note? Previously you were just stuck there, but now you&apos;ll see a helpful link that will take you back to the top of the Collection. </p>
<p>Also, beneath the Nav menu, you&apos;ll now see an option to take you to a random Note in the Collection. This won&apos;t be useful for every Collection, of course, but can be for some. You can try it out while using the Notenik Tips, which is one place where it might be fun. And there&apos;s a keyboard shortcut for this as well &#8211; Shift-Cmd-]. </p>
<p>Another new enhancement will hopefully be helpful for everyone &#8211; Notenik will now recall the size and position of your various Collection windows, and will restore them when they are next opened. This includes the position of the left/right divider. Hopefully this will make usage a little more convenient for all. </p>
<p>And, finally, this release includes a few fixes for MathJax processing that were pointed out to me by a kind and knowledgeable user. A couple of these came out in point releases after 8.2.0, and there are yet one or two more released first in 8.3.0. </p>
<p>So that pretty much rounds out the list for 8.3.0. As always, if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>
<p>See the <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/version-8.3.0.html">Version History entry</a> for additional details, with links to new and updated pages in the Notenik Knowledge Base. </p>

		  Added Markdown support for the creation of tables, using pipes and dashes; added a new command beneath the File menu to Open the current Collection&apos;s Folder in the macOS FInder; improved editing of Index fields; added new command to Clean a Link, removing common tracking parameters; improved the readability of the Keyboard Shortcuts Reference page in the Knowledge Base; added a new Markdown Cheat Sheet. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>For me, Notenik has always been an adventure as much as an application. </p>
<p>I&apos;m currently reading <em><a href="https://www.amortowles.com/the-lincoln-highway-about-the-book/">The Lincoln Highway</a></em> by Amor Towles, a tale in which one surprise after another awaits our adventurers, who initially start out with such simple and straightforward and highly achievable intentions, only to find their plans and wants and needs changing beyond recognition almost as soon as they set out. </p>
<p>Yes, I think to myself, Notenik has been a bit like that. </p>
<p>Take Notenik&apos;s Markdown parser, for example. In the beginning there wasn&apos;t one. And I had no plans to write one. After all, two very accomplished open-source Markdown parsers already existed, so I could use one of them. Even better, I could allow the user to choose which one they wanted to use! And I could work on other things. </p>
<p>But then I reached a point at which&hellip; I wanted to be able to link from one Note to another, wiki-style. And not only was this not part of the original Markdown syntax, it wasn&apos;t even widely available as a common extension. And so, I began to think&hellip; maybe I should write my own? </p>
<p>And so I did. So now Notenik lets you choose between three parsers. But only the one allows inter-Note linking. </p>
<p>But another part of the adventure has been feature requests from users. Someone wanted to know why I didn&apos;t support Mathjax, for people who wanted to do maths. Well, the last time I wrote anything that would require Mathjax was in my sophomore year of college&hellip; which was a <em>long</em> time ago. So I ignored that request for a while. But then I received an email from a Math professor in England who really, seriously, wanted Mathjax support. And who was willing to work with me until I got it right. </p>
<p>And so I took a little side trip in order to incorporate Mathjax into Notenik. </p>
<p>And then various people requested other Markdown extensions: footnotes, citations, fenced code blocks, etc. And while I had never planned to implement any of these, as each new request came in, I thought&hellip; &quot;Well, it can&apos;t be <em>that</em> hard, let me give it a go,&quot; and so each new extension became another chapter in the evolving saga. </p>
<p>All of which is relevant, because a kind user on the Mac App Store recently left a nice review of my app, which included a feature request for Markdown tables. And, of course, I knew that this was a common Markdown extension that I had so far ignored, and thought would be more trouble than it was worth, but then I started thinking about it, and then thoughts turned into code, until now, with the latest release of Notenik, support for making tables from pipes and dashes is now supported. </p>
<p>(Now I do have to admit that the same reviewer also said that, of the three parsers, only Down functions correctly. Unfortunately, he didn&apos;t give me anything else to go on, so I&apos;m not sure what sort of Markdown coding wasn&apos;t being parsed correctly by the Notenik parser. If he, or anyone else, has any problems that they&apos;d like to report, then I&apos;m always open to hearing problem reports via email.) </p>
<p>Of course, there are also other improvements in the latest release (and the one before that, which I never got around to doing a write-up on, and so will include here). </p>
<p>Let&apos;s see, in no particular order&hellip; </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I used the new table formatting feature to reformat the keyboard shortcuts page into a table, to make it more readable. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also added a Markdown cheat sheet to the Knowledge base, along with a Help menu item to quickly pull it up, for those who have not yet memorized the basic syntax. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a command to the <code>File</code> menu to open the current Collection folder in the macOS Finder. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expanded the size of the Edit widget for fields of type <code>Index</code>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Borrowed some <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/TrackerZapper">code</a> from <a href="https://rknight.me">Robb Knight</a> to cobble together a new feature allowing you to clean a Link, stripping out various common tracking parameters, leaving you with the part of the URL actually needed to get you to your intended destination. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now use the include style of <code>quote-body</code> to include only the body of a second Note, and format it as a <code>blockquote</code>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleaned up a couple of cases where Notes were showing up in lists, but didn&apos;t really need to be there. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Included the Seq value on the Tags tab, for Collections sorted by Seq. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, finally, straightened out some issues with model Collections that were hampering users&apos; abilities to create new Collections, especially when launching Notenik for the first time.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&apos;s it for the latest Notenik adventures!

		  Added new Include command within the Notenik Markdown parser, to include a file, or another Note; expanded the Author Name Variable Modifierer to allow first name first to be extracted; added a new command and keyboard shortcut to quickly toggle the Streamlined Reading mode; added a new command to format a special Notenik URL to open the current Collection at a later date; added a new Merge Template Variable Modifier to perform a very rudimentary conversion of HTML to Markdown. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>The big news in this release is the ability to use an <code>include</code> command within the Body of a Note, to include a second Note or separate file into the Display of the first Note. If you&apos;re including a second Note, then you have the option to specify a style of inclusion: just the Body of the second Note, or the entire Note, or a formatted quotation. (And, of course, if you need to, you can nest your includes.) </p>
<p>I implemented a Custom URL scheme for Notenik some time ago, and provided a handy way to copy a URL to open a specific Note, but neglected to provide anything similar to generate a URL to open the Collection itself, without specifying a particular Note. This oversight has now been corrected with a new command beneath the <code>Collection</code> menu: <code>Copy Notenik URL for Collection</code>. </p>
<p>If you&apos;re using Streamlined Reading, it can often be handy to switch back and forth between that mode and the normal, unstreamlined, display, showing all fields with non-blank values. There&apos;s now a new command and keyboard shortcut to allow you to toggle the Streamlined mode on and off, avoiding repeated trips to the Collection Preferences. Again, look beneath the <code>Collection</code> menu to find this new time-saver. </p>
<p>And, for those of you who use Merge Templates, there are a couple of minor new enhancements: the ability to format a person&apos;s name in a first name first fashion, and a very rudimentary ability to convert HTML to Markdown. </p>
<p>And that does it for the latest release! As always, if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved.

	  <title>Notenik 7.9.0 - Taking Outlining to a New Level</title>
	  <link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://notenik.app/news/notenik-7.9.0-taking-outlining-to-a-new-level.html"/>

	  <summary>
		  This release includes a powerful new function for renumbering the Seq values for a range of Notes, indent and outdent commands, and some improvements to Web Book publishing. With these new options, outlining in Notenik is more powerful than ever. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>Notenik was never intended to be an outliner, but outlining has sort of gradually crept into the app over the last six months or so, starting with the <a href="https://notenik.app/news/notenik-6.3.0-leveraging-the-new-level-field.html">introduction of the Level field in Notenik 6.3.0</a> . </p>
<p>Version 7.9.0 adds a couple of finishing touches that were missing before. </p>
<p>First of all, if you select a range of Notes (in a Collection sorted by <code>Seq + Title</code>, and containing Seq and Level fields), and then right-click to open the context menu for the List tab, you&apos;ll see an option that says <code>Modify Seq&amp;hellip;</code>. If you select this function, then you&apos;ll see a new window that allows you to specify a new Seq value for the first Note in the range. Click OK after entering that new value, and the entire range will be renumbered, with Notes following the first falling into line behind their leader, maintaining the same outline structure, but changing Seq and Level values appropriately. It&apos;s quite a powerful way to restructure an outline in Notenik, and brings Notenik a bit closer to having most of what one might need when working on an outline. </p>
<p>Next, there are new <code>Indent</code> and <code>Outdent</code> commands to be found beneath the <code>Note</code> menu, with appropriate keyboard shortcuts. </p>
<p>And then the way Web Book publication works has been improved. It&apos;s now just another export format, instead of a separate entry beneath the <code>File</code> menu. And, when generating a Web Book as a Site, the first page now gets written out twice, once with the file name of <code>index.html</code>. This removes the need for the ability to generate a redirection page for the first page, and so that option has been retired. </p>
<p>There&apos;s now an impressive array of functionality in Notenik to aid in outlining, and I&apos;ve updated the page on outlining in the Knowledge Base to collect all of this together in one place: see <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/using-notenik-as-an-outliner.html">Using Notenik as an Outliner</a> for all of the details. </p>
<p>And that does it for the first release of 2022! As always, if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>

		  This release includes a new Notenik Intro, the addition of a new, optional header line when publishing a Web Book, a new <code>Include Children</code> field useful when using outlining with streamlined reading, and a new Sort option to view things in pure Date order (irrespective of Status). 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>I received some requests recently for a kinder, gentler introduction to Notenik that would include some visuals, in addition to the words. </p>
<p>So with this release a new &quot;Notenik Intro&quot; has been introduced. You can experience it in one of several ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As with the full <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/notenik-knowledge-base.html">Notenik Knowledge Base</a>, the new <a href="https://notenik.app/intro/EPUB/html/welcome-to-notenik.html">Notenik Intro</a> has been published as a Web Book that is available on the <a href="https://notenik.app/index.html">Notenik.app</a> website. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you&apos;re firing up Notenik for the very first time, then you should see the Intro opened for you automatically, in edit mode, so that you can browse through it, but also edit it as desired to use as your first Notenik Collection, if you&apos;d like. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever you create a New Collection, you&apos;ll see the Notenik Intro available as a starting option. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the addition of the new Intro, this meant that the Notenik.app website now contained two different Web Books: one for the full Knowledge Base, and one for the Intro. So I fixed something else that had been bugging me for a while, and added an optional header line that could be included when generating a Web Book. You can see this in action by viewing either (or both!) of these documents on the website. I&apos;ve used this top line to contain a book title on the left, and a link back to the full website on the right. I think you&apos;ll agree that the addition of this header line makes these web books easier to use. </p>
<p>This release includes one more feature useful for Streamlined Reading and Web Books: a new field titled <code>Include Children</code>. I haven&apos;t made use of it yet for either of the Notenik Web Books, so I can&apos;t point you to an example, but it allows you to pull the children of a Note into the parent&apos;s Display, in cases where you might wish the child Notes to be separately addressable, but don&apos;t want to make the reader keep clicking on a &quot;Next&quot; link to advance from one to the next. </p>
<p>And then, finally, I&apos;ve added a new Sort option that allows a Collection to be sorted by Date (without respect to Status) plus the Seq field (if used) followed by the Title field. I had a user request this feature, and it seemed reasonable to me, so there it is. </p>
<p>Those are the changes in the latest release. Check them out in the app and, where you need more info to make sense of them, refer to the Notenik Knowledge Base for the details. And if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>

	  <title>Notenik 7.7.0 - Class Templates are Introduced</title>

	  <summary>
		  This release introduces Class templates. Each different Class value within a Collection can have its own template, and that template can limit the fields included on the Edit tab for Notes of that Class, and can also supply default values for any fields that are included. This is one of those features that can be used in lots of different ways, for many different purposes, so it&apos;s worth sitting down and having a good think about how you might be able to put this feature to use for your Notes. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>This release is focused on an expanded use of the Class field, including the introduction of the very useful Class templates. </p>
<p>The Class field was introduced in 7.5.0, and its associated features have been expanded in 7.6.0, and now again in 7.7.0. </p>
<p>With this release, Notenik will recognize a subfolder named <code>class</code>, and then use each of the files found therein as class templates. Class templates can be used for three very useful purposes. </p>
<p>First, each filename will be recognized as a valid Class value, whether or not that value was identified as such in the Collection template file. </p>
<p>Second, you can omit certain fields from a Class template file, and then only the remaining fields (the ones included in the Class template file) will be shown on the Edit tab, when that Class value is specified for a particular Note. </p>
<p>Third, you can supply default values for any of the associated fields, and these will then be pre-populated when you create a new Note with that Class. </p>
<p>A couple of these functions above involve a bit of a chicken-and-egg type problem: the Edit field will be configured and pre-populated based on the Class, but there&apos;s no way to specify the Class until you get to the Edit tab! </p>
<p>The solution here is the new command, found beneath the <code>Note</code> menu, to create a <code>New Note w/Options</code>. When you select this menu item, you will be presented with a window allowing you to select the Class for the new Note. Once you hit <code>OK</code> on this screen, you will be taken to the Edit tab, blank except for the values you&apos;ve specified. </p>
<p>This new Options screen also allows you to fill in a couple of other useful fields. First, the Note&apos;s title, just because that seems a natural thing to do at this point in your flow. But then there are also the Level and Seq fields for the new Note. The Level field will default to that of the last Note selected before invoking this screen, but you can change it if you like. The Seq field will then change appropriately to reflect the Level you&apos;ve selected, in order to place the new Note just after the last Note selected. </p>
<p>Notenik also has some new Display logic associated with certain special Class values, especially when a Collection is in the Streamlined Reading mode. For example, a Class value of <code>quote</code> will result in the body of the Note being displayed with <code>blockquote</code> styling. And if you use the new <code>Attribution</code> field to indicate the source of the quote, that field will be neatly shown below the quotation itself. </p>
<p>As long as I was allowing a Class template to limit the fields shown on the Edit tab, it also seemed like a good time to remove calculated fields from the Edit tab, since they can&apos;t be modified directly by the user anyway. So now the Edit tab will be that much cleaner, allowing you to focus on the fields of interest to you. </p>
<p>Those are the heavy hitters in this release. Be sure and read more about these new features in the Notenik Knowledge Base, where you&apos;ll find all the details. And if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>

		  Notenik 7.6.0 should contain a little something for everyone, including some additional sort options, an improvement to the Quick Action window, more reasonable handling of data from deleted fields, the ability to include images in a Web Book, as well as the ability to specify your own available values for the new Class field. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>This is another grab bag release, with a handful of unrelated changes, but everyone should find a little something useful in the mix. Some of these changes were suggested by users, and some were ones I dreamt up all on my own. </p>
<p>First of all, a Sort Option to sequence your list by Date Modified has been added. No matter what sort of information you&apos;re storing in Notenik, it will probably at least occasionally be useful to sort your Notes to see those that have most recently been modified. This was a user request. </p>
<p>Next, I&apos;ve added a keyboard shortcut to the option to Reverse a Sort. Combining the CMD key with a number key will change the sort field used for a Collection to one of the nine available options. (See the Sort submenu beneath the Collection menu for details.) But now <code>CMD 0</code> will reverse the sequence for any of these options. Especially when switching from one option to another, I often find I want to reverse the sequence, and so this new keyboard shortcut makes that a snap. </p>
<p>Another user request was to have the Quick Action window retain the last Collection Shortcut entered as a default for the next time a Quick Action is taken. This can make an action even quicker, and I&apos;m already using it to speed up some of my Notenik work. </p>
<p>One more change in this release involves the removal of fields from a Collection. This isn&apos;t the most common of operations &#8211; usually you&apos;re selecting fields when you create a new Collection, or adding more later. But occasionally, after I&apos;ve added some fields, I later realize that they&apos;re not really needed and, in fact, are just getting in the way. At that point I open the Collection Preferences and uncheck the fields I no longer want. So far, so good, it would seem. But what if some of your Notes already have data in those now-deleted fields? Unfortunately, Notenik did not previously have a systematic way for dealing with this sort of abandoned data. With this release, though, those fields and values will be systematically purged from your Notes, to prevent any untoward things from happening somewhere downstream. This is not a feature you&apos;ll be using every day, I&apos;ll wager, but good to know it&apos;s there when you need it. </p>
<p>And then there&apos;s yet another change in this release, only useful if you&apos;re using the recently added option to <code>Generate a Web Book</code>. In that case, the <code>Image Name</code> field can now be used to include an image that will appear towards the top of a page, between the <code>Title</code> and the <code>Body</code>. </p>
<p>And then the new <code>Class</code> field has been fleshed out a little further, with the user given an option for specifying his or her own values for the field, as an alternative to the ones that seem useful to me. Still more to come in terms of functionality associated with this field, but this is a small step forward. </p>
<p>And that&apos;s it! Hope you find something useful here. And if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&apos;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>

		  Notenik 7.5.0 makes a few small improvements, including reorganizing some of the app&apos;s menus, as well as rearranging things on the Collection Prefs screen. The Advanced Search option is the new feature that might be most widely appreciated. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>Sometimes it&apos;s enough to just improve a few things for users, rather than adding a bunch of completely new stuff. </p>
<p>This release adds an Advanced Search function. The new window allows you to opt out of including certain common fields in a search, when you&apos;re looking for more focused results. It also gives you the option of doing a case-sensitive search. These are not options you need everyday, but it&apos;s nice to have them there when they&apos;d be helpful.  </p>
<p>Adding a new menu option made me rethink Notenik&apos;s overall menu structure, resulting in a couple of changes that should make everything a little easier to navigate. If you&apos;re looking for sort options, these are now found beneath the Collection menu. Search options, including the new Advanced Search option, are now beneath the new Nav menu, along with a few more navigation options. And the Format menu is now gone, with the <code>Display Appearance</code> option now beneath the App preferences. </p>
<p>This release also adds a new field label and type of <code>Class</code>. The intent here is to have a field that tells Notenik something about the intended role of a particular Note within the overall structure of a Collection. But this is mostly a placeholder for now. Look for future enhancements in coming releases to more fully express my design intent here. </p>
<p>In the meantime, though, the addition of this new field was the proverbial straw that broke the camel&apos;s back when it came to the Collection Preferences window, so I&apos;ve reorganized this thing a bit to make it easier to use, and make better use of available screen real estate. </p>
<p>A new user recently noticed that, if you have the Edit tab visible, Notenik allows you to quit the application, or close the window, without saving any in-flight changes you had made. I&apos;ve fixed this, so Notenik will save your changes automatically in this scenario. </p>
<p>And then, one more slight improvement: when sorting by the Seq field, Notenik will now perform padding on up to six segments (separated by dots or dashes), whereas before it stopped at four. </p>
<p>If you&apos;re a Notenik user, then hopefully you will find at least a few of these refinements to be helpful. </p>

		  <p>Notenik 7.4.0 addresses some common issues that often arise when making use of  <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/wiki-style-links.html">Wiki Style Links</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Issue # 1</strong>: You&apos;re writing one Note, then realize you want that Note to link to a different Note, but that different Note does not yet exist. Before 7.4.0, Notenik would allow you to create the link but then, when you clicked on it, would just give you a (not very helpful) error message. </p>
<p>The fix? When you save a Note (or reload a Note you have edited externally, using your favorite text editor), Notenik will check all of the Note&apos;s wiki style links to make sure they point to Notes that actually exist. For any that don&apos;t yet exist, Notenik will automatically create them! And the new Note will contain a handy pointer back to the Note that created it, via its wiki style link. </p>
<p>Problem solved! </p>
<p><strong>Issue # 2</strong>: You&apos;ve named a Note one way (including a verb and an object, let&apos;s say) and then want to later refer to that Note via a wiki style link. But given the context of the reference to that Note, you want to use slightly different wording in the new sentence you&apos;re constructing (calling out just the object, let&apos;s say). </p>
<p>The solution? Now you can add a special <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/also-known-as.html">AKA</a> field to a Collection, and then add one or more alternate identifiers to a Note, allowing you to then wiki link to that Note using any of the alternates you have called out. For example, even though the <a href="https://notenik.app/docs.html">Notenik Knowledge Base</a> includes a Note for this new field that is titled &quot;Also Known As,&quot; I can link to that Note using a Wiki Link of <code>[AKA]</code>, because the <code>Also Known As</code> Note contains an <code>AKA</code> entry that calls out <code>AKA</code> as an alternate identifier for that Note. </p>
<p>Pretty handy, eh? </p>
<p><strong>Issue # 3</strong>: You&apos;ve created a bunch of wiki style links that refer to various other Notes. And now you&apos;re looking at a Note in your Collection. And you can see what other Notes are linked to from this Note, but then you wonder&hellip; which Notes, if any, link to this Note? </p>
<p>The answer? <em>Backlinks!</em> By enabling the new field type called <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/back-links.html">Backlinks</a>, Notenik will automatically keep track of backlinks in your Collection, and make them available on the Display tab. </p>
<p>And so now you have automatic bidirectional linking of Notes within a Collection: write one link to go from one Note to another, and you can then automatically traverse your wiki style links in either direction. </p>
<p><strong>And One More Thing</strong>: The Notenik Knowledge Base now has a new article in the <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/putting-it-all-together.html">Putting It All Together</a> section called <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/write-a-web-book.html">Write a Web Book</a>, that gives you some pointers on how to create a web book of your own. Hope you find it useful! </p>

		  <p>Version 7.3.0 of Notenik includes a handful of helpful improvements. </p>
<h5 id="improved-seq-and-level-defaults-for-drag-and-drop">Improved Seq and Level Defaults for Drag and Drop</h5>
<p>When pasting an item (such as a URL) into a List sorted by Seq, and when the drop point is between existing rows, Notenik will now do a better job of setting reasonable defaults for both Seq and Level for the new Note. </p>
<h5 id="improved-recognition-of-parent-realm-folders">Improved Recognition of Parent Realm Folders</h5>
<p>Notenik allows you to drag a folder to be opened onto its app icon in the dock. That folder can be either a Notenik Collection or a parent folder containing Notenik Collections. Before this change, if a folder contained a single text file named <code>robots.txt</code>, then that would be treated as a Note, and so the folder would be opened as a Collection. After this change, such a folder will be more productively treated as the object of an <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/open-parent-realm.html">Open Parent Realm</a> command. </p>
<h5 id="parent-realm-folders-now-appear-on-open-recent-menu">Parent Realm Folders Now Appear on Open Recent Menu</h5>
<p>After you execute the <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/open-parent-realm.html">Open Parent Realm</a> command (either explicitly via the <code>File</code> menu, or implicitly by dragging a folder onto the app icon), the Parent Realm folder will now be added to the the <code>Open Recent</code> menu, making it available to be easily reopened later. </p>
<h5 id="streamlined-new-collection-process">Streamlined New Collection process</h5>
<p>It seemed a bit confusing to have so many different options for creating a new Collection, so I&apos;ve combined them. Now there is just one <code>File</code> menu option, that says <code>New Collection&amp;hellip;</code>. This option walks you through several screens where you can pick a location, pick a name, and pick a Collection type, and then shows you the Collection Preferences screen where you can make any final adjustments to the configuration of your New Collection. </p>
<h5 id="saving-security-scoped-bookmarks">Saving Security-Scoped Bookmarks</h5>
<p>Notenik has been enhanced to try to extend the life of access permissions for Collections assigned Shortcuts, so as to reduce the number of times a user has to re-authorize access to a folder. See <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/tailor-collection-preferences.html">Tailor Collection Preferences</a> for info on assigning a Shortcut to a Collection. </p>
<h5 id="undo-provided-for-note-deletions">Undo Provided for Note Deletions</h5>
<p>If you delete a Note by mistake, then you can use the Undo function (beneath the Edit menu) to undo the deletion, with the only caveat being that any note attachments will not be restored. </p>
