		  Now you can create your own custom Starter Packs, and then use them to initialize new collections!

		  <p>Version 16.5.0 of Notenik adds support for custom Starter Packs. </p>

<p>Unlike many other (perhaps <em>all</em>&#8230;?) somewhat comparable note-taking apps, Notenik allows you to tailor each different collection (aka <em>folder</em>) full of notes in several meaningful ways. Most significantly, you can customize the particular set of <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/field-labels-and-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">field labels and field types</a> used within each Collection, so that different collections can be used for quite different purposes. And then you can also tailor the look and feel of a collection by changing the CSS used for the display of its notes, and even the HTML layout used. </p>

<p>All of these changes can be made simply by editing a few text files but, for some time now, when you create a new collection, Notenik has allowed you to choose from a number of different <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/built-in-starter-packs.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starter Packs</a> that can be used to initialize your new collection with a particular configuration. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve added new Starter Packs to Notenik every once in a while but, still, as the developer, I&apos;ve been the only person with the power to create a new one, or to enable other users to make use of one. </p>

<p>Up until now, that is! </p>

<p>The latest version includes two related features. </p>

<p>The first is called <em>Clone</em>, and can be found beneath the <em>File</em> menu. This function will copy the selected collection to a new location, but leaving behind the actual notes that make up the content of the collection. </p>

<p>The user may then use their trusty text editor to make any further changes to the clone (such as adding more sample data), before using it as a custom Starter Pack. </p>

<p>Once these further edits are complete, the user may copy this cloned collection into the <code>Starter Packs</code> folder within the user&apos;s iCloud Drive Notenik folder. </p>

<p>It will then become available as an option the next time the user executes the process of creating a <em>New Collection</em>. </p>

<p>Note that, when exchanging Starter Packs with other users, it will be most convenient to first compress each Pack into a single Zip file. The user will then need to decompress the Pack before making use of it. </p>

<p>Also note that the Notenik Discourse Forum now has a <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/c/starter-pack-sharing/22" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new category</a> set up specifically for Starter Pack Sharing. </p>

		  With the latest release, Notenik can be used as an app launcher, with some interesting features. Is this a compelling use case? Heck, I don&apos;t know. But it&apos;s kind of fun! 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>The <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-16.4.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16.4.0 version of Notenik</a> makes it a little easier to use Notenik as a Mac application launcher. </p>

<p>Is this a good idea? </p>

<p>Heck, I don&apos;t know. </p>

<p>There are certainly many other ways to launch an app on your Mac, including software designed specifically for this purpose. </p>

<p>But you be the judge. </p>

<p>Let me show you how you can use Notenik in this way, and then you decide if this use case makes any sense. </p>

<section id="section-for-step-1-create-an-apps-catalog">

<h3 id="step-1-create-an-apps-catalog">Step 1: Create an Apps Catalog</h3>

<p>This is pretty easy to do. <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/creating-and-tailoring-a-collection-of-notes.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a new Collection</a> somewhere handy, such as the Notenik Folder within iCloud Drive. You can just pick <em>Basic Notes</em> as your starting point. Call it whatever makes sense to you, such as <code>Apps Catalog</code>. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-step-2-import-your-applications-metadata">

<h3 id="step-2-import-your-applications-metadata">Step 2: Import your Applications Metadata</h3>

<p>Now it&apos;s time to <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/import-apps-folder.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Import your Apps Folder</a> by selecting <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Apps Catalog</em>. </p>

<p>You&apos;ll then see the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/import-settings.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Import Settings</a> window. Make sure <em>Additional Fields</em> is set to <em>Add</em>, and <em>Rows (aka Notes)</em> is set to <em>Match and Add</em>. </p>

<p>Now pick your primary <em>Applications</em> folder as the import source, and click <em>OK</em>. </p>

<p>Notenik will then import the names of those applications, along with a few metadata fields, into your Apps Catalog. </p>

<p>Note that this step can be repeated later as changes are made to your <em>Applications</em> folder. New applications will be added, and any firm metadata changes will be updated. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-step-3-add-any-useful-info">

<h3 id="step-3-add-any-useful-info">Step 3: Add Any Useful Info</h3>

<p>In particular, you can use the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tags.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tags</a> field to categorize your apps in any way that is meaningful to you. For example, I&apos;ve assigned <code>markdown</code> to the various apps that can be used as Markdown editors/parsers. Note that, although the Tags field may be initially populated with an app&apos;s <em>Application Category</em>, it will not be overridden by a later import if the field has been user-modified. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-step-4-set-a-keyboard-shortcut">

<h3 id="step-4-set-a-keyboard-shortcut">Step 4: Set a Keyboard Shortcut</h3>

<p>Start by using the <em>Collection &gt; Copy Notenik URL for Collection</em> item to get a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/custom-url-scheme.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik Custom URL</a> into your system clipboard. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s what this might look like, when you paste it into an empty document using your text editor. </p>

<pre><code>notenik://open?path=/Users/hbowie/Library/Mobile%20Documents/iCloud~com~powersurgepub~notenik~shared/Documents/Apps%20Catalog
</code></pre>

<p>Now add <code>&amp;amp;select=action</code> to the end of this string, with no intervening spaces or punctuation, so that the result looks something like this. </p>

<pre><code>notenik://open?path=/Users/hbowie/Library/Mobile%20Documents/iCloud~com~powersurgepub~notenik~shared/Documents/Apps%20Catalog&amp;amp;select=action
</code></pre>

<p>Now assign this URL to an available keyboard shortcut, using whatever app/tool you prefer. </p>

<p>I&apos;m using <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyboard Maestro</a>. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve assigned the Hot Key CTRL-OPT-R to a Macro titled &apos;Notenik Apps Catalog&apos;. The Macro only contains one Action, of type <em>Open a URL</em>. Then paste the complete URL you&apos;ve created into the URL field. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-step-5-type-your-keyboard-shortcut">

<h3 id="step-5-type-your-keyboard-shortcut">Step 5: Type Your Keyboard Shortcut</h3>

<p>Now when you type your new Keyboard Shortcut, two things will happen: </p>
<ol>
<li>Notenik will open your Apps Catalog (or bring it to the front, if it&apos;s already open); </li>
<li>Notenik will pop up its <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/select-a-note-for-action.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Note Selector</a> window. </li>
</ol>

</section>

<section id="section-for-step-6-select-your-application">

<h3 id="step-6-select-your-application">Step 6: Select Your Application</h3>

<p>Now you can select one of your applications, via either of two means: </p>
<ul>
<li>Type three or more letters found anywhere in the name of the application; </li>
<li>Type a pound sign, followed by three or more letters found in the <em>Tags</em> field of any of your App Notes. </li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever method you use, select the desired app from the list that results (if it&apos;s not already selected).  </p>

<p>Next make sure the Action popup at the bottom of the <em>Note Selector</em> window is set to <em>Launch Link</em>. (Note that this popup will default to whatever value was last selected for the the given Collection, so you should only have to pick this once.) </p>

<p>Then hit the <em>OK</em> button, or simply press <em>return</em> on your keyboard. </p>

<p>Then your App should launch, using the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/link.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link to Launch field</a>! </p>

<p>Voila! </p>

		  Sometimes it&apos;s hard to figure out what makes Notenik different from all the other note-taking, Markdown-parsing, text-file-wrangling apps out there. So let&apos;s start with the most significant, core differentiator: each folder of text files managed by Notenik has its own unique template file, and each template file defines a set of fields for the notes within that folder.

		  <p>Sometimes it&apos;s hard to figure out what makes Notenik different from all the other note-taking, Markdown-parsing, text-file-wrangling apps out there. </p>

<p>So let&apos;s start with the most significant, core differentiator: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each folder of text files managed by Notenik has its own unique <em>template</em> file&#8230; </p></li>
<li><p>And each template file defines a set of <em>fields</em> for the notes within that folder&#8230; </p></li>
<li><p>And each field is defined by a <em>label</em>, a <em>type</em>, and (sometimes) a <em>configuration</em>&#8230; </p></li>
<li><p>And the file extension for the template file specifies the file extension to be used for notes created within that folder. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let&apos;s look at an example of how this works in practice. </p>

<p>Here are the contents of a sample template file, which is just an ordinary text file that you can open with your favorite text editor. Here I&apos;m using BBEdit. </p>

<p><img src="images/Sample Template File.png" alt="Sample template file, viewed within BBEdit" /> </p>

<p>And here&apos;s what the <em>Edit</em> tab will look like when adding a new note to the collection (aka <em>folder</em>) using this template. </p>

<p><img src="images/Sample Edit Window.png" alt="The Edit Tab within Notenik" /> </p>

<p>So let me just point out a few interesting bits here: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every note must start with a Title field, and conclude with a Body field (although they can be given different labels). </p></li>
<li><p>In between those two, a note can have many different fields, of many different types. </p></li>
<li><p>The field type will, among other things, determine what sort of widget appears on the <em>Edit</em> tab for that field, when adding a new note within that folder, or when editing an existing note. </p></li>
<li><p>Some field types, such as <em>status</em>, can also have a configuration specified in the template. In this case, the allowable status values are being specified, and these are the values that will appear in the drop-down menu when selecting a value for this field. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So here&apos;s what a sample note might look like after being added to this collection, and when viewed on Notenik&apos;s <em>Display</em> tab. </p>

<p><img src="images/Sample Display Tab.png" alt="The Display Tab within Notenik" /> </p>

<p>And, just to round things out, and remove the last bit of mystery, here&apos;s what the resulting note file might look like (again viewing with BBEdit). </p>

<p><img src="images/Sample Note File.png" alt="Sample note file" /> </p>

<p>And then, perhaps, I should make one final point for today&apos;s <em>Adventure</em> post. </p>

<p>One may always edit a Notenik template file directly, if one is so inclined, and this is sometimes the best way to build some new and exotic sort of collection. </p>

<p>However, direct editing of the template file is generally a last resort, and Notenik offers these other ways of tailoring a template file, before resorting to direct editing. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>When creating a new collection, Notenik currently offers sixteen different <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/starting-collection-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starting Collection Types</a> from which you may choose, each with a different collection template. Even when creating something new, you can help yourself by picking a good starting point from this list.  </p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Collection Settings</em> window allows you to pick from several common field labels and types in order to add them to your collection template. </p></li>
<li><p>After initial creation, Notenik offers a handy window to <em>Rename, Add or Remove</em> a field, available beneath the <em>Collection</em> menu. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&apos;s generally best to exercise these options to get you as far as possible, and then perform direct editing of your template file to implement any final tweaks. </p>

<p>Hopefully this post has helped to explain one of the key ways in which Notenik differs from other similar apps. </p>

<p>Now, as to <em>why</em> Notenik works this way&#8230;? </p>

<p>Well, when creating a list of items, with each row containing a number of columns, I often wished to have one or more columns containing some significant amount of text&#8230; but then a traditional spreadsheet app quickly gets awkward and unwieldy. </p>

<p>And then when writing some significant chunks of text, I often wished to organize many such chunks into a coherent collection, and then sort, filter and format those chunks using some set of discrete fields, in addition to the more free-form bits of text&#8230; but then a traditional document editing app proves disappointing. </p>

<p>So Notenik attempts to provide a happy medium in between these two extremes, and the collection template file is the key to pulling this all together. </p>

		  The new web book <em>Intro to Website Creation using Notenik</em> (at https://notenik.app/web-intro/index.html), is now complete, and ready for review and use. This tutorial makes use of a Notenik starter pack titled <em>HTML for People demo</em>, and the complete version of this starter pack has just been released as part of Notenik Version 16.2.0, which is now out in the Mac App Store. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>After publishing the <a href="https://notenik.app/web-guide/index.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Creating a Website using Notenik</a> in October of last year, one of Notenik&apos;s longtime users published <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/website-creation-guide/592/4?u=hbowie" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a list of links</a> that might be helpful to website creators. </p>

<p>And on that list was a site created by <a href="https://blakewatson.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blake Watson</a>, called <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML for People</a>. His site is in the form of a web book, offering a tutorial on HTML for those new to webmaking. It walks a new user through the entire process of building a personal website, and makes the entire journey easy and fun. </p>

<p>I really liked Blake&apos;s site, and it made me wonder if I could create a companion web book that would supplement Blake&apos;s instructions, following the same trail, but at every step showing how Notenik could be used to perform the same tasks. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve been working on this companion book for the last several months, and I&apos;m happy to say that it&apos;s now as complete as I can think to make it. </p>

<p>(That being said, I&apos;m eager to hear feedback from others, and expect to make further improvements to the book as feedback comes in.) </p>

<p>There are really four somewhat separate achievements here. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>I learned a bunch of stuff that I hadn&apos;t known before. </p></li>
<li><p>I realized that Notenik had numerous shortcomings, and I&apos;ve tried to rectify all of these that I could identify. You&apos;ll find these changes sprinkled through <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-history.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent updates</a>, starting from Version 15.5.0. The last few of these have just been released, in <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-16.2.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Version 16.2.0</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>I&apos;ve finalized (at least for now) and published my companion guide, which I&apos;m calling an <a href="https://notenik.app/web-intro/index.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intro to Website Creation using Notenik</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>This tutorial makes use of a new Notenik Starter Pack, # 16, titled <em>HTML for People demo</em>, providing all of the Notenik folders and files needed to make your way through the tutorial. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This has been a very rewarding three-month journey, and I&apos;m thankful to Blake Watson for his site, and for the Notenik users active in <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the app&apos;s Discourse forum</a>, who are continually finding ways to make Notenik a better, more useful Mac app. </p>

		  <p>Notenik version 16.0.0 is out, just in time for the holidays! </p>

<p>Starting with the big picture, this means Notenik has had roughly 150 significant releases, starting with 1.1.0 on July 15, 2019. This works out to about 1 release every two weeks, over a period of five and a half years! And Notenik today has an average rating of 4.8 stars out of 5 in the Mac App Store, based on every rating ever made, starting with that first release. So this feels like a milestone worth celebrating! </p>

<p>Zooming in to the details of this release, I&apos;ll start with the invention of a couple of new Markdown extensions. I&apos;ve added a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/start-a-segment.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">segment</a> command that can be used to start and end a portion of your writing that you wish to embed within a <code>div</code> or an <code>aside</code>, as examples. And then there&apos;s the new <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/inject-block-attributes.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inject</a> that can be used to inject common attributes (class, id, and/or style) into the following block element (such as a <code>p</code> or a <code>ul</code>). </p>

<p>And then there&apos;s my favorite. I&apos;ve been using <a href="https://nova.app/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nova</a> a lot recently, and I was missing some way to open a folder in Nova when starting from a Notenik project folder. Then I discovered a way to do it using <a href="https://help.panic.com/nova/url-schemes/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nova URL Schemes</a>, and so there&apos;s now an application general setting to <em>Gen Open in Nova Items</em>, and turning this on will achieve the desired effect. Very handy if you&apos;re using Nova regularly! </p>

<p>Oh, and I added support for Markdown highlighting, using the syntax found in the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#highlight" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown Guide to Extended Syntax</a>. </p>

<p>And then there were a couple of other changes to improve handling of sync conflicts (when using a third-party sync service), and to allow a project folder to become a user&apos;s Essential Collection. </p>

		  Notenik version 15.9.0 is now available from the Mac App Store, and is chock full of improvements, many of them inspired by Blake Watson&apos;s web book <em>HTML for People</em>. An early draft of the Notenik companion to Blake&apos;s book is also available for review.

		  <p>Notenik version 15.9.0 is now available from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac App Store</a>, and is <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-15.9.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chock full of improvements</a> (including a few fixes). </p>

<p>As with our <a href="https://notenik.app/adventures/easier-webmaking-with-notenik-15.8.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prior adventure</a>, many of the enhancements here were inspired by working my way further through Blake Watson&apos;s excellent web book <em><a href="https://htmlforpeople.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML for People</a></em>. </p>

<p>Watson&apos;s book is for beginners, but I keep learning new things, and seeing new ways to make Notenik easier to use, and this release includes more of these sorts of refinements. </p>

<p>And while my Notenik companion to <em>HTML for People</em> is not yet complete, I think it is now far enough along to make it available for any interested reviewers. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve decided to publish it at <a href="https://notenik.app/web-intro/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notenik.app/web-intro</a>. </p>

<p>If you&apos;re at all interested, I&apos;d love to hear any feedback you might have. </p>

<p>And, as always, bug reports can be filed and enhancement requests can be submitted at <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discourse.notenik.app</a>. </p>

		  The web book <em>HTML for People</em> made me realize that webmaking with Notenik was harder than it needed to be. So now, it&apos;s a little bit easier.

		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>A Notenik user recently turned me on to a great web book, <em><a href="https://www.htmlforpeople.com/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML for People</a></em>, authored by Blake Watson. </p>

<p>Blake&apos;s book takes the reader through a quick and painless introduction to Hypertext Markup Language, and makes the point (near and dear to my own heart) that HTML is not just for technologists, but is a document format meant to be accessible to everyone. </p>

<p>Blake&apos;s how-to gave me the idea of trying to write a companion document that would walk a user through the same steps of simple website creation, but using Notenik, rather than straight HTML. </p>

<p>That companion document is still in work, but a funny thing happened along the way. </p>

<p>I discovered that some of the Notenik steps I was trying to describe were actually harder than they needed to be. </p>

<p>And so, I fashioned some enhancements to make things a bit easier. </p>

<p>First, I realized (finally, I guess) that what I&apos;ve been calling a <em>parent realm</em> in Notenik for so long has actually evolved into something that might as well be called a <em>project folder</em>.  So I made that nomenclature change, which seemed a valuable step towards making Notenik a little more straightforward, and a little less esoteric. </p>

<p>And then, once I had made that change (in my own thinking, as well as in the software and documentation), I wondered why in the world simple text files (such as README and LICENSE files) were not visible within Notenik when they appeared at the top level of a project folder. </p>

<p>And so, now they are. </p>

<p>And then, I wanted to make Class and Status fields visible within a content collection, without the user having to worry about them initially, but both fields looked a bit awkward with empty values, so I wondered why Notenik didn&apos;t have a way to specify default values for those fields. </p>

<p>And so now it does. </p>

<p>And then, when I was describing how a script file could be viewed and edited, I realized that the long-time file extension of &apos;<code>.tcz</code>&apos; that I had been using â even though it made it easy for Notenik to recognize those files â made it difficult for other apps to recognize what was basically a tab-delimited file format. And so, I thought, why not allow script files to have file extensions of &apos;<code>.tsv</code>&apos; (for <em>tab-separated values</em>), so long as they are stored in a folder named <code>scripts</code>? </p>

<p>And so now it&apos;s much easier to open and edit a script file using Numbers or Excel or even <a href="https://www.moderncsv.com/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern CSV</a>. </p>

<p>And then Blake suggested the user download one or more classless CSS frameworks and try those out, and I realized that sounded pretty cool, but there was no way to easily download one of those things and apply it within Notenik. </p>

<p>And so now there is. </p>

<p>And then I realized that, while it was easy to apply CSS and load image files within Notenik, there was no easy way to transfer those things to a website being built from a Notenik collection. </p>

<p>And so now there is. </p>

<p>And I&apos;m still not done going through all of Blake&apos;s book! So no doubt there will be more to come. </p>

<p>But that already seemed like quite a lot, and I was getting close to two weeks without a Notenik release, so I&apos;ve bundled up all these enhancements and released them into the wild as Notenik 15.8.0. </p>

<p>Available now from the Mac App Store. </p>

	  <title>Notenik&apos;s Flexible Seq Field</title>

		  Notenik&apos;s Seq field is deceptively simple, but surprisingly powerful. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>Notenik tries to follow Alan Kay&apos;s dictum that &quot;<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-story-behind-Alan-Kay-s-adage-Simple-things-should-be-simple-complex-things-should-be-possible" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible</a>,&quot; and this is nowhere more evident than in the many possible uses of the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/seq.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seq field</a>. </p>

<p>A Sequence identifier is meant to be an arbitrary value whose only purpose is to establish a position within a sequence. </p>

<p>A Sequence identifier can consist of letters or numbers, or some combination of the two. </p>

<p>In many scenarios, it would be most useful for each Note in a Collection to have a unique Seq value, but Notenik does not insist on this. </p>

<p>Sequence values will sort into what will generally appear to be a &quot;normal&quot; sequence, based on an algorithm of incrementing on the right and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(arithmetic)" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carrying</a> overflow to the left. </p>

<p>As you would expect, a value of &apos;12&apos; will appear after a value of &apos;2&apos;. </p>

<p>But also a value of &apos;AB&apos; will sort after a value of &apos;B&apos;. </p>

<p>A structure can be implied by using a series of values separated by periods, or dots: something like &apos;15.3.1&apos;, and this might imply that the Note so identified should be treated as a &quot;child&quot; of &apos;15.3&apos;. </p>

<p>In fact, Seq values can be used as part of an outlining scheme, and there is a separate post on <a href="https://ntnk.app/outliningwithnotenik" class="wiki-link">Outlining with Notenik</a>. </p>

<p>A Seq field can be useful to impose some sort of taxonomy on your Notes, but Notenik itself does not define any particular taxonomy to be used. </p>

<p>Note that there are several different sort options that make use of the Seq field. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Seq + Title</code> will sort everything by Seq and, if there are duplicates, will then sort by their Title fields. </li>
<li><code>Tasks by Seq</code> can be useful if the Seq field is being used as a priority indicator; in addition, a Status field will be expected, and completed tasks will sort separately from tasks still to be completed. </li>
<li><code>Tags + Seq</code> can be useful if you are using the Seq field for some sort of priority within Tag values. </li>
<li><code>Date + Seq</code> can be useful if you are using the Seq field to enter a time of day. </li>
<li><code>Rank + Seq + Title</code> can be used if you wish the Seq field to be used within a separate Rank field. </li>
<li><code>Folder + Seq + Title</code> can be used to sort by Seq within each subfolder. </li>
</ul>

		  In which I announce a couple of recent improvements that should make it easier for new users to create their own websites with Notenik. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>My original personal â and still most important â Notenik use case is website creation. </p>

<p>And yet I know that Notenik users have struggled over the years trying to figure out how to fashion their own sites using Notenik. </p>

<p>But it&apos;s not that I&apos;m <em>trying</em> to make things difficult. It&apos;s just that I&apos;ve been doing this for so long that I tend to take a lot of knowledge for granted. </p>

<p>And so, based on <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/the-image-slug-variable-isnt-producing-any-output/591/3?u=hbowie" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent feedback</a>, I&apos;ve taken a couple of additional steps to make things a bit easier for those who might be trying to use Notenik as a static site generator. </p>

<p>The first is publication of a <a href="https://notenik.app/web-guide/index.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more complete tutorial</a> on the subject, always available from the <a href="https://notenik.app/docs.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docs page</a> of the Notenik.app website. </p>

<p>The second consists of some improvements to Notenik itself, and to the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/website.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website starter pack</a>, just released in <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-15.5.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik 15.5.0</a>. </p>

<p>Hopefully this will prove helpful for those Mac users trying to create their own websites. If there&apos;s other stuff that&apos;s tripping you up, or that you think could be improved, I would encourage you to post something on the <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik Discourse Forum</a>. It&apos;s a friendly, helpful group that hangs out there, and I respond quickly to any new posts. </p>

		  <p>I awoke the other morning to see that Notenik had received a nice review from Lou Plummer on his <a href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/notenik-a-well-designed-plain-text-notes-plus-app" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppAddict</a> page. I was gratified to read his review, and also happy to make acquaintance with his app reviews more generally. Lou describes himself as a &quot;dedicated Mac user,&quot; and his reviews seem to mostly focus on macOS apps, which is in alignment with my own interests. I look forward to reading more of his pieces, and perhaps discovering some new Mac apps to add to my own toolbox. </p>

		  Notenik can now import selected quotations from WikiQuote.org, hopefully saving time and potential data entry errors. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>Anyone who&apos;s been seriously collecting quotations for any length of time knows that many casual quotation sites offer lots of &quot;feel good&quot; quotations that are often attributed to a particular author, without identifying the precise source of the quotation. And so, perhaps, it is not surprising that many of these &quot;quotations&quot; turn out to be <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">misquoted and/or misattributed</a>. </p>

<p>So it&apos;s good to know that one of the more reliable sources for quotations is <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiQuote.org</a>, one of the lesser-know siblings of big brother WikiPedia. WikiQuote will generally provide a verified author, source title and date for any quotation, and its collection of quotations is pretty extensive. </p>

<p>WikiQuote has been around for quite some time, and my old app <a href="https://iwisdom.en.softonic.com/mac" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iWisdom</a> used to have a handy feature that allowed a user to dowload a particular quote from that site. </p>

<p>Notenik <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/version-15.4.0.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version15.4.0</a> now adds a similar ability, using <a href="https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwiftSoup</a> to parse an author&apos;s page on WikiQuote, and then allowing the Notenik user to specify a search string that will allow them to zero in on a particular quotation of interest, and then bring it over into their personal Notenik commonplace book. </p>

<p>Because we&apos;re parsing a web page, and not reading information from a database, the retrieval process is certainly not perfect, but I believe it&apos;s good enough to often be useful, saving the time and potential inaccuracies associated with manually typing in a particular quotation. </p>

<p>For those of you assembling digital commonplace books, I hope you find this new feature to be of use! </p>

		  Notenik supports MultiMarkdown metadata and YAML frontmatter, but has a preference for its own file format. If this seems a bit of a mystery to you, then read on. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>Notenik recognizes and supports several different file formats, including MultiMarkdown with its metadata,  as well as Markdown with YAML frontmatter. </p>

<p>But Notenik has its own file format, which is slightly different from these others. </p>

<p>Why is that? </p>

<p>There are a number of reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Historical happenstance. I devised the Notenik file format after learning of MultiMarkdown but before the use of YAML frontmatter became popular. </p></li>
<li><p>A CMS/database influence. With the Notenik format, everything is a field, and everything has a label, including the Title and the Body of each note. To some extent, this just reflects my long history doing database development. And also my prior use of the Drupal content management system, in which every field is explicitly named. </p></li>
<li><p>Maximum field flexibility. Notenik allows the use of multiple Markdown fields within a note. A second Markdown field, for example, might be used as a teaser or preview for a blog post. So rather than structure a Notenik file as a single Markdown document with some optional metadata in front, I chose to structure it so that Markdown (and a variety of other data types) could be accomodated in other fields. </p></li>
<li><p>Preference for readability over bare-bones data entry. Because every field has a field title, and because blank lines are used to separate fields, a Notenik file is highly readable by anyone opening it using a text editor. And Notenik expects to take that formatting off of your hands when creating new notes. On the other hand, for users who create text-based notes using nothing but a text editor, the Notenik format requires a few additional keystrokes. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So while I try to maintain maximum interoperability with these other formats, Notenik continues to prefer its own &#8211; slightly different, slightly quirky, but very straightforward &#8211; format. </p>

<p>See the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/note-file-format.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik Knowledge Base</a> for a complete description of the Notenik file format. </p>

		  When people finally stumble across Notenik, they often ask &quot;How have I never heard of this before?&quot; Well, here&apos;s where I provide a definitive answer to that question. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>I&apos;ve had more than one user stumble across Notenik, try it out, and then ask &quot;How have I not come across this before?&quot; </p>

<p>Well, it&apos;s not because I&apos;m <em>trying</em> to keep it a secret. </p>

<p>But Notenik does have a sort of &quot;perfect storm&quot; of attributes that seem to keep it from becoming a household word. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>It&apos;s only available for the Mac.</em> Availability on multiple platforms â at least on multiple devices throughout the Apple ecosystem â seems to constitute table stakes for a lot of people these days, including those who write about tech.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>It&apos;s nowhere near the bleeding edge.</em> Notenik is written in Swift and AppKit, technologies that are well supported by Apple. But it doesn&apos;t run on Apple Vision Pro, or on the Apple Watch, or even on the iPad or iPhone. And it doesn&apos;t make use of SwiftUI or any of Apple&apos;s latest technologies. So it&apos;s not part of, or adjacent to, any other hot topics for tech writers. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Positive reviews don&apos;t get much traction.</em> I&apos;m proud to say that Notenik was very well reviewed in what turned out to be the absolute last print issues of <em>MacFormat</em> and <em>MacLife</em> magazines. And also proud to say that Notenik has an average rating of 4.8 stars in the Mac App Store, with 68 ratings, and reviews that say things like &quot;A hidden powerhouse.&quot; But these sorts of positive reviews don&apos;t actually seem to attract much attention. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Open source but not Unix.</em> Because Notenik is open source software, there&apos;s no money for advertising. But most of the open source community is focused on command line tools that run on any Unix platform â including, but not limited to, the Mac. So Notenik does not hit the open source sweet spot. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Independent but not Indie.</em> I&apos;m an independent developer, and I&apos;m the developer for Notenik. But when people talk about <em>indie developers,</em> they are mostly talking about developers who are independently making a living by selling their software and, increasingly, about game developers. Also, I&apos;m not using any independent distribution channels for Notenik, so my indie status is compromised by virtue of distribution through the App Store.  </p></li>
<li><p><em>Not popular enough for the productivity gurus.</em> There seems to be a whole group of writers about productivity tools and techniques these days. These people seemingly make some sort of living writing about how constantly switching from one tool/technique to another, and then back again, makes them more productive â as measured, I suppose, by their ability to churn out more and more of these pieces faster and faster. But perhaps because Notenik is already so well documented, it has not attracted much attention from these sorts of folks. </p></li>
<li><p><em>No plugins.</em> Some tools gain popularity because they allow development of plugins that can be dynamically loaded by their apps. Notenik doesn&apos;t work like that. So there&apos;s no room for incidental add-on development and discussion. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, when a recent user discovered Notenik and wondered why he&apos;d never heard of it before, I was only half-joking when I responded: </p>

<p>&gt; Shhh&#8230; it&apos;s a well kept secret. Only the cognoscenti are allowed to know about it. Welcome to the club! </p>

<p>In all seriousness, though, feel free to tell your friends and neighbors about Notenik. As I said, I&apos;m not <em>trying</em> to keep it a secret. </p>

<p>It&apos;s just sort of worked out that way. </p>

		  How Notenik is designed for &quot;the long flourishing&quot; recommended by David Brooks, rather than the cheap and easy hits so prevalent in modern American life. 
	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
		  <![CDATA[
		  <p>David Brooks had a good column in the NY Times yesterday: &quot;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/opinion/entertainment-junk-psychology.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Ik4.1aY-F8w9FF0kD2H0&amp;smid=url-share" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Junkification of American Life</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>In it he talks about the slippery slope of sliding from art to entertainment to distraction, and ending up in a place where the cheap and easy hit always wins out over &quot;the long flourishing.&quot; </p>

<p>Although this phrase hadn&apos;t occurred to me before, my Mac app Notenik is definitely designed for this latter goal. </p>

<p>To wit: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>It&apos;s designed for use on the Mac, which is itself an example of the long flourishing, and less inclined to be used for the easy hits so often found on phones and tablets. </p></li>
<li><p>Notenik avoids any sort of attention-grabbing tricks. Notenik will never nag you or beg you for attention. Instead it patiently waits for your intention. </p></li>
<li><p>It&apos;s not flashy, and its appearance doesn&apos;t try to entice you with any slick graphics. </p></li>
<li><p>It&apos;s designed for the long haul. It&apos;s all open-source, and all of its data is stored in plain text files. So both the app and its data are designed to be survivable. </p></li>
<li><p>It intentionally avoids the modern app merry-go-round on which users are encouraged to continually try the next shiny new thing, and then try to rebuild their workflows around something new every few months or so. Notenik is designed to be easy and straightforward for initial use, but deep enough to reward ongoing learning and exploration, and flexible enough to be used for many different purposes. </p></li>
<li><p>Its primary focus is on the <a href="https://hbowie.net/tags/written-word.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written word</a>, rather than still or moving images. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So if you&apos;re trying to adjust your life to consume less junk, and more substance, Notenik is ready to help. </p>

<p>It&apos;s got quite a few nice improvements but for today&#8230; </p>

<p>Let&apos;s talk about tags and Postel&apos;s Law. </p>

<p>My <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em> defines <em>tag</em> as &quot;a label attached to someone or something for the purpose of identification or to give other information.&quot; </p>

<p>Tagging is a well-nigh universal practice for organizing a bunch of notes, and Notenik has always had robust support for tagging. You can find the details <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tags.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the Knowledge Base</a>, if you&apos;re interested. </p>

<p>But there are different systems for associating a tag with a text-based note, and Notenik has gradually expanded its support in this department.  </p>

<p>Notenik&apos;s original approach â which is still the default â is to expect the tags to be entered into, and saved as, their own field. Which has always seemed just fine to me. </p>

<p>But many Notenik adventures transpire as the result of an encounter with someone else who does things differently. </p>

<p>And I&apos;ve always tried to have Notenik adhere to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postel&apos;s Law</a>, which states: </p>

<p>&gt; Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others. </p>

<p>So another way of entering tags is to make them hashtags, by prepending a hash symbol (&apos;#&apos;) to each tag. <a href="https://evantravers.com/articles/2022/02/28/notenik/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evan Travers</a> originally let me know about this, and so Notenik was modified to recognize and preserve hashtags. </p>

<p>And now, I&apos;ve had a couple of users <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app/t/inline-tags-as-possible-new-feature/543" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">request a third way</a> of associating tags with a note, by entering hashtags directly into the body of a note. </p>

<p>And so now, with the latest release, Notenik now supports this third approach as well, via a new <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tags-handling.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tags Handling</a> option. </p>

<p>The goal, as always, is to maximize interoperability between Notenik and other apps and note-taking systems out there. </p>

		  Is it yet another &quot;just a bunch of text files&quot; app? Or is it a personal database system for the Mac? Well, a bit of both, to be honest.

		  <p>I must confess that my Notenik Mac app has a bit of a split personality. </p>

<p>On the one hand, it stores all of its data in text files and supports Markdown. So it&apos;s one of many apps designed to maintain folders full of notes written in Markdown and stored as plain text files. So we might call this the &quot;just a bunch of text files&quot; personality. </p>

<p>On the other hand, notes can have fields, and the fields can have different labels and types, and different folders can have different sets of fields, and each folder of notes also has a special template text file that provides something like a schema definition for that particular folder. So we might call this the &quot;personal database&quot; personality. </p>

<p>So why can&apos;t Notenik make up its mind, and just be one thing or the other? </p>

<p>Well, because straddling this divide offers so many interesting opportunities, both for development and for use. On the one hand, all of Notenik&apos;s data is easily accessible, and can be read (and edited!) with any text editor, and many Markdown editors, and many other &quot;just a bunch of text files&quot; organizers. On the other hand, all sorts of useful information can be maintained and tracked, and sorted in different ways, and exported to a spreadsheet for further manipulation whenever needed. </p>

<p>This is one reason why Notenik continues to evolve, with a new release every couple of weeks, and with an <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active user community</a>. </p>

<p>And this split personality is one of the main attributes that makes Notenik such a uniquely useful Mac app. </p>

		  <p>Notenik Version 15.1.0 has just been released into the Mac App Store, and it includes a new, optional, Outline tab that can be displayed when using the Seq and Level fields to build an outline. </p>

<p>You can select this option by selecting <em>Show</em> or <em>Hide</em> Outline Tab, which can be found beneath the Collection menu. </p>

<p>When the tab is shown, it will appear as a third tab on the left side of the Collection window, just to the right of the Tags tab. </p>

<p>This tab will work similarly to the List tab, in terms of working with your Notes, but will allow you to selectively show and collapse sections of your outline by clicking on the conventional disclosure triangles, thus allowing you to focus on one section of your outline at a time, while hiding others that might otherwise obscure your area(s) of focus. </p>

<p><img src="images/outline-tab.jpg &quot;Screenshot of Notenik with Outline tab shown&quot;" alt="Screenshot of Notenik with Outline tab" /> </p>

<p>This is a great example of a feature engendered by the Notenik Discussion forum, which can be found at <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discourse.notenik.app</a>. Various users there have been indicating for some time that they would like to see such a feature and for a long time I avoided the idea because I couldn&apos;t quite see a good way to implement it. But users persisted, so I began to explore possibilities with the forum, and with some tentative code, and after a series of betas âÂ each eliciting thoughtful and helpful feedback â things seemed to gel. So a hearty thanks to all of the forum users who participated and provided ideas and feedback! </p>

<p>As I&apos;ve said before, my original vision for Notenik included not a thing about outlining, and it&apos;s certainly not a dedicated outliner. But Notenik has evolved into something of a personal information multitool, and outlining has become one of the tools that has proven useful. And while dedicated outliners such as OmniOutliner and Bike have definite advantages, there are also advantages to an outlining tool that fully accommodates accompanying Markdown text, as well as other useful fields, such that your outline is not <em>only</em> an outline. </p>

		  <p>The ability to select an item from one location, then drag it to another, and drop it into a desired new location â what we call <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/drag-and-drop-items-mh35852/mac" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drag and drop</a> on a Mac â is a powerfully convenient feature of macOS. </p>

<p>Notenik supports drag and drop in many situations, and two of them are especially suited for use with outlining. </p>

<p>The first involves dragging a note from within an outline to a new location within the same outline. Notenik will conveniently adjust the seq value of the dropped item to fit into its new location, based on the note above that location, and then will move the note from its original location to its new location. </p>

<p>The second involves dragging a note from another collection into a collection that is sorted by seq. In this case Notenik will helpfully adjust/add both seq and level fields to fit the new note into its new location before copying the note to the outline. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve found both of these techniques to be helpful in different circumstances, and hopefully you will as well. </p>

		  Notenik makes it easy to indent or outdent a single note or a range of notes.

		  <p>Any attempt to build an outline will soon run into the following issue: </p>

<p>You&apos;ve already created a note at a given level, but now want to demote it to a lower level (higher numeric value); this function is generally referred to as <em>indenting</em>, since it typically indents the line below its parent. </p>

<p>And then, if you can indent, you might well also wish at times to be able to <em>outdent</em>: to promote a note to a higher level (lower numeric value). </p>

<p>Notenik provides these two commands beneath the Note menu, along with handy keyboard shortcuts. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>OPT-CMD-]</code> will indent the selected note(s); </li>
<li><code>OPT-CMD-[</code> will outdent the selected note(s). </li>
</ul>
