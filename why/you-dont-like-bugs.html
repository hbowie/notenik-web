You Don&apos;t Like Bugs</strong></p><p>Let&#8217;s face it: no software is perfect. Every developer is prone to injecting bugs into their code from time to time. And we&#8217;ve created our fair share. </p>

<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: </p>
<ul>
<li>We try to avoid dependencies on other people&#8217;s software &#8211; especially anything new or exotic; </li>
<li>We use our own software on a daily basis; </li>
<li>Notenik users have a forum they can use to report bugs; </li>
<li>We read every post that appears on the forum; </li>
<li>We <em>always</em> prioritize bug fixes over enhancements; </li>
<li>We rarely go more than a couple of weeks without releasing a new version; </li>
<li>We often post betas on the forum to validate bug fixes. </li>
</ul>

<p>The result? </p>

<p>We honestly can&#8217;t think of a time when a bug hasn&#8217;t been fixed within a week or two of being reported. </p>
