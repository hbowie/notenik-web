<p>Notenik has been favorably reviewed in <em>MacLife</em> and <em>MacFormat</em> magazines, receiving four out of five stars (with one star deducted for being Mac-only). </p>

<p>And Notenik currently has a rating of 4.8 out of 5 on the US <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac App Store</a>, based on sixty-plus ratings, with numerous positive reviews. </p>

<p>And even though every submission of a new version allows me, as the developer, to reset the app&#8217;s ratings, I have never found any reason to do that. </p>
