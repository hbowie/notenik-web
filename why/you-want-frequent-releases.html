<p>Let&#8217;s quantify this. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Version 1.1.0 was released on July 5, 2019. </p></li>
<li><p>Version 13.4.0 was released on November 16, 2023. </p></li>
<li><p>And there were 140 releases in between those two. </p></li>
<li><p>How do we know this? It&#8217;s all in the <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/version-history.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowledge Base</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>So that&#8217;s a total of 142 releases over about 225 weeks. </p></li>
<li><p>So that actually works out to a new release about every 1.6 weeks. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course sometimes they don&#8217;t come along that often. </p>

<p>And perhaps we might someday run out of stuff to improve. </p>

<p>But that&#8217;s our track record to date, based on past and recent history. </p>
