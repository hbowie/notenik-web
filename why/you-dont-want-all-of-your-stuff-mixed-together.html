You Don&apos;t Want All Of Your Stuff Mixed Together</strong></p><p>Some apps mix all of your stuff together in a single location. </p>

<p>Notenik supports that. </p>

<p>But it also supports you organizing your stuff into as many different folders (i.e. <em>collections</em>) as you would like. </p>

<p>So you can have different collections for different purposes. </p>

<p>Each with their own kinds of stuff. </p>
