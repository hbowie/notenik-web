<p>What information do you want to present? What sorts of data may benefit from separate handling? What fields will you need for filtering and sorting, based on your organizational schemes? </p>

<p>Each field in a Notenik Collection will have a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/field-labels-and-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">label and a type</a> (although the type may sometimes be inferred from the label). </p>

<p>At minimum, each piece of content will have a title field and a body field. </p>

<p>Other fields may be added as needed. </p>

<p>See the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/field-labels-and-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lists of Labels and Types</a> for help with identifying different types of data that may be useful. </p>

<p>Again, as you think of the sorts of fields that may be useful to you, you might find a need to further refine your list of content types, since different content types may be associated with different sets of fields. </p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Our <em>post</em> content type might usefully have the following fields associated with it (in addition to title and body). </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tags.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tags</a> - to identify topics associated with each post. </li>
<li><a href="https://notenik.app/kb/status.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Status</a> - to distinguish between posts that are ready to &#8220;go live,&#8221; vs. others that might still be in work. </li>
<li><a href="https://notenik.app/kb/date.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Date</a> - to indicate the date of publication. </li>
<li><a href="https://notenik.app/kb/teaser.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teaser</a> - to provide a brief summary for longer posts. </li>
<li><a href="https://notenik.app/kb/image-name.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Name</a> - to identify an image that is to appear at the top of the post. </li>
</ul>
