<p>For any website, you will have one or more types of content. For a simple blog, for example, you will have blog posts. Where Notenik excels, though, is in building sites with more complex content types, and with multiple types. But you need to start out by identifying these. </p>

<p>Try to come up with a short, simple, meaninful name for each content type, and make a list of these. </p>

<p>You may well refine this list over the next few steps, but it&#8217;s good to establish a starting list initially. </p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>As an example, let&#8217;s say we want to create a simple blogging site. We can quickly think of two somewhat different types of content. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>page &#8211; a static page, such as an <em>About</em> page. These pages may be updated from time to time, but will tend to be created once, and then continue to be referenced as permanent pages in the site. </p></li>
<li><p>post &#8211; a blog post. New posts will be added on a regular basis. </p></li>
</ul>
