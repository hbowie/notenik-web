<p>Once upon a time, when the world (and the Web) were young, Apple thought it would be cool to provide a &#8220;Web Sharing&#8221; option. In effect, this offered a way to turn your Mac into a web server. And then it also provided each user with a folder named <code>Sites</code>, as a peer to your <code>Documents</code> folder. So you would place your website(s) in your Sites folder, and your Mac with Web Sharing enabled would then allow you to access those sites using Safari, or any other Web browser. </p>

<p>After a while, as Mac usage expanded, it became clear that most users would not be creating their own web sites, and so the Sites folder and the Web Sharing option went away. </p>

<p>Sort of. </p>

<p>Because if you ever created a Sites folder, or if any earlier version of macOS created it for you, then it will generally be preserved by later versions of macOS. And you can always create it yourself, even if macOS will no longer create it for you.  </p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s the issue of <em>Web Sharing</em>&#8230; </p>
