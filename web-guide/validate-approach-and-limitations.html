<p>We will be building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website#Static_website" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">static website</a> using the Notenik app. The site will be static in the sense that it will consist of static web pages &#8211; meaning that there will be no backing database on the server &#8211; but you will be able to update it whenever you wish, and in any manner you like. </p>

<p>Notenik provides a user-friendly interface for managing your site&#8217;s content, but relies on some coding skills to create your website. In other words, there is no WYSIWYG interface for designing your web pages. </p>

<p>This may sound a little intimidating at first, but should not be viewed as overwhelming, and has the advantage of relying on very stable web technologies, and ensuring that your content is always yours, always accessible to you, and always interoperable, without any reliance on proprietary (and often transient) software or services. </p>
