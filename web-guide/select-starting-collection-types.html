<p>Now it&#8217;s time to build the Notenik Collection(s) that will house your content. Note that there are two possible approaches here. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a separate Collection for each content type. With this approach, each different content type will have its own folder within the <code>content</code> folder referenced earlier. </p></li>
<li><p>Use the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/class.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class</a> field to distinguish between different content types stored in the same Collection. With this approach, your single content Collection can simply occupy the entire <code>content</code> folder. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>When you create a new Collection, Notenik offers you a number of <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/starting-collection-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starting Collection Types</a> from which you can choose. </p>

<p>If you find one that seems close to your intentions, then starting with one of these models can save you time. </p>

<p>On the other hand, once you become more proficient with Notenik, you may decide you just want to start with <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/basic-notes.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basic Notes</a> and then tailor as needed. </p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>For our website building example, we will start with the <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/website.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website</a> model. </p>

<p>Note that this supports the two content types we&#8217;ve been discussing — <em>page</em> and <em>post</em> — and it uses the class field to distinguish between these two content types within a single collection. </p>

<p>Note also that this starting Collection Type will actually install a number of other folders in addition to the collection folder itself. </p>
