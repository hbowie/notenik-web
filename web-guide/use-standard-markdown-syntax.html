<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/markdown-markdown-images" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useful summary from Digital Ocean</a> on the standard Markdown syntax for images. </p>

<p>The only Notenik issue here is that you will need to <em>Enable Local Image References</em> on your <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/tailor-collection-settings.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collection Settings</a> in order to see the images on the Display tab when viewing your Notes within Notenik. </p>

<p>The other issue here is the placement of your images. You have a couple of sub-options here. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Generate your HTML pages in the same folder that contains your content (i.e., Note) files. Then you can place all your image files in a subfolder named <code>images</code> and use relative addressing to reference your images. Since your output HTML will be in the same folder as the original Notes, that addressing will work for both your Notes and your web pages. </p></li>
<li><p>Generate your HTML pages in a separate folder. The issue here is that you will need to copy your <code>images</code> folder — including all of its content — from your content folder to your web folder, and will need to keep them in sync after that, as you add content and images to your site. </p></li>
</ul>
