You Like Enhancements</strong></p><p>Almost every new version of Notenik includes at least one or two enhancements &#8211; we generally aim for a number more in the range of three to five. </p>

<p>These are often small improvements, and they won&#8217;t all be of interest to every user. </p>

<p>Some of these come from user suggestions, and others are generated internally. </p>

<p>And at some point &#8211; who knows? &#8211; we might run out of ideas to make Notenik even better than it is today. </p>

<p>But, based on our track record to date, I woudn&#8217;t bet on it. </p>
