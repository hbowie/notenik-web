It&apos;s Open-Source</strong></p><p>You may be a fervent supporter of <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source software</a>. </p>

<p>Or you may have never looked at a line of computer source code in your life, and never used a piece of software you didn&#8217;t pay for. </p>

<p>We&#8217;re good with both approaches. </p>

<p>But just so you know, every line of application code that goes into Notenik is <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/notenik-swift" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stored on GitHub</a>, which means anyone can view it, or even make a copy and modify it. </p>

<p>Which means fewer worries about the app suddenly disappearing without a trace, never to be updated again. </p>
