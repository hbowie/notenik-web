<p>Notenik currently offers fourteen different ways of sorting your notes. </p>

<p>Just select any of those from a drop-down menu and then your notes will be sorted by the selected field, or combination of fields. </p>

<p>Notenik does not offer unlimited options when it comes to sorting your notes. For that you would need a spreadsheet or a database. </p>

<p>But the available sorts &#8211; by date, or by sequence number, for example &#8211; make Notenik into a pretty flexible tool. </p>
