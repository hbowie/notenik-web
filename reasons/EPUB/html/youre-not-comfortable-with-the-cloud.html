You&apos;re Not Comfortable With The Cloud</strong></p><p>People talk about storing their information in &#8220;the cloud&#8221; a lot these days. </p>

<p>But really, is there such a thing? </p>

<p>Because there is no single cloud. There are a lot of companies selling cloud storage to others &#8211; including other companies. </p>

<p>But every cloud storage situation is different. And every supplier is different. And sometimes clouds disappear. And sometimes their storage formats are limited, or downright proprietary. </p>

<p>But Notenik stores all of its information on a local drive, either in your Mac or attached to it. </p>

<p>From there you can back it up, and/or sync it to other devices through the cloud service of your choice. </p>

<p>But that&#8217;s all up to you. </p>
