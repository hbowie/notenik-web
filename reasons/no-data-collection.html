No Data Collection</strong></p><p>There are lots of &#8220;free&#8221; apps and services these days that make their money by harvesting data about their users and then selling that on to various interested parties. </p>

<p>And that kind of deal may be acceptable to lots of people. It might even be acceptable to you. And that&#8217;s ok with us! </p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not part of the Notenik deal. Just so you know. Neither Notenik nor the <a href="https://notenik.app" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik website</a> will ever collect any data about you. </p>

<p>So you don&#8217;t have to ever worry about who we&#8217;re selling it to, or why they want it. </p>

<p>Because we don&#8217;t collect it in the first place. </p>
