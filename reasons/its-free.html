It&apos;s Free</strong></p><p>The old saying that &#8220;You get what you pay for&#8221; does tend to be true in most cases. We pay for lots of things, and often pay more than the minimum in order to obtain something of value. </p>

<p>But Notenik is a labor of love. It&#8217;s not intended for the mass market. And we&#8217;re in the enviable position of being able to make something pretty wonderful without having to charge for it. </p>

<p>If you can afford to, and you&#8217;d like to show your appreciation by purchasing a virtual coffee for us, then your donation will be warmly appreciated. </p>

<p>But there is no payment ever required or expected in order to gain access to all of Notenik&#8217;s features. </p>
