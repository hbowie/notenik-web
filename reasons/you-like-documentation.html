You Like Documentation</strong></p><p>Many apps these days trust that you will figure out how to use them through trial and error, or through reference to a few help screens, or a video or two, or by doing web searches. </p>

<p>We do things a little differently with Notenik. </p>

<p>Notenik comes with a complete <a href="https://notenik.app/knowledge-base/EPUB/html/notenik-knowledge-base.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowledge Base</a> that is always kept up-to-date, and contains everything you might ever want to know about the app. </p>

<p>And the Notenik Knowledge Base is itself a Notenik Collection. </p>

<p>And you can always open it, and read it, and search it, within Notenik itself. </p>

<p>Even without an active Internet connection. </p>

<p>And then, of course, the Knowledge Base also provides an example of how Notenik can be used. </p>
