For Its Native Mac Interface</strong></p><p>Many apps these days are written to look pretty much the same whether you are using them in a web browser, on a Mac, on a PC, or on an Android phone. And we understand the economic factors that are driving companies to make these sorts of compromises. </p>

<p>But Notenik uses a native Mac user interface. And so, if you&#8217;ve been using a Mac for any length of time, you&#8217;ll feel right at home when you fire up Notenik. </p>
