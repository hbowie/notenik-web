			<h1>Version 7.1.0 - Taking Dark Mode All the Way</h1>
			<p class="news-date">Posted on 31 Aug, 2021</p>
			<h2 id="turning-to-the-dark-side-on-the-display-tab">Turning to the Dark Side on the Display Tab</h2>
<p>I was kind of a late adopter of the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-a-light-or-dark-appearance-mchl52e1c2d2/mac">Dark Appearance Setting on the Mac</a>. </p>
<p>At first I just didn't see the point. </p>
<p>But I kept trying it out until it started to grow on me a bit. </p>
<p>Until now I'm using it all the time, and turning on the light setting now seems a bit of a shock. </p>
<p>Notenik has mostly supported Dark Mode from the beginning &#8211; everywhere except on the Display tab, where the default was still to show black text on a white background. </p>
<p>The reason for this was a little bit complex. I'm using the Mac's WebKit API to format the Display tab, which means I'm essentially formatting each Note display as a Web page &#8211; and I hadn't yet incorporated the latest HTML to allow the page to follow the user's wishes in terms of the light/dark setting. </p>
<p>But Notenik 7.1.0 fixes all that. As a bonus, when you use one of Notenik's functions to generate an actual Web page from a single Note or a Collection, the generated pages will also include the code to respect the user's preferences. </p>
<p>I think the results look pretty sharp, if I do say so myself. </p>
<p>(Of course, you can still supply your own CSS if you'd prefer different colors.) </p>
<h2 id="highlighting-search-text-matches">Highlighting Search Text Matches</h2>
<p>Another new feature in 7.1.0 that also shows up on the Display tab is highlighting of matching text when you execute a Search function. Previously Notenik would take you to the Note(s) containing the text you were searching for, but would not show you where the text was found. For a brief Note, this wasn't usually a problem, but for longer Notes, it could be a bit frustrating to try to figure out where the matching text had been found. With 7.1.0, the matching text will be clearly highlighted. </p>
<h2 id="generating-wikipedia-links">Generating Wikipedia Links</h2>
<p>The final little goodie in this release is the ability to automatically populate a Link field by taking the Title of a Note and then transforming it into a Link to the English Wikipedia page on that topic. Not everyone will find this feature useful, but if you have a Collection of your favorite Authors, for example, it can be handy for populating a Link field for each author. You can find this new function within the Note menu, about halfway down the list. </p>
<h2 id="enjoy">Enjoy!</h2>
<p>Hope you enjoy the new release! If you have questions or problems or suggestions for further improvements, just send me an email at <a href="mailto:hbowie@notenik.net">hbowie@notenik.net</a>, and I'll get back to you as quickly as I can. </p>
