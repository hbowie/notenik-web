				<h3>Notenik 9.0.1 - Hooked on Notenik</h3>
				<p class="news-date">Posted on 31 Mar, 2022</p>

				<div id="content">
					<p>The last couple of releases focused on integration with the <a href="https://hookproductivity.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hook app</a>. I&#8217;ve had people ask me about Hook integration for a while now, and I finally invested enough time and energy to figure out how all of this might work. <a href="https://twitter.com/luccogzest" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luc Beaudoin</a> and his team were very helpful and responsive when I had questions, with the happy result that they have just today <a href="https://discourse.hookproductivity.com/t/integration-with-notenik-note-taking-app/4889/3" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced the availability of their integration scripts for Notenik</a>. It&#8217;s been a pleasure working with the team, and it&#8217;s nice to see one more user requested fulfilled. </p>

<p>There were some other enhancements as part of 8.9.0, 9.0.0 and 9.0.1 &#8211; generally along this same theme of integration. A couple of new commands were added to the custom URL scheme, to make it possible to access a Note via a complete file path as well as via its Timestamp. Hook integration was enabled via the addition of some new custom AppleScript commands. Also, you can now drag a text file onto Notenik&#8217;s app icon, and Notenik will attempt to open the enclosing folder as a Collection, and then select the dropped Note. </p>

<p>Also corrected a problem with Notenik&#8217;s Markdown parser that affected a list of numbers, one per line, without any spacing or punctuation. And also added a Collection pref to allow the Notenik parser to turn straight apostrophes into curly ones. </p>

<p>Oh, and when you hit the tab key while in a Link field, Notenik will now advance you to the next field, as one might expect, instead of actually inserting a tab character into the middle of a hyperlink. </p>

<p>And there&#8217;s also a new addition to the Notenik documentation. Articles such as <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/obsidian-vs-roam/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one from The Sweet Setup</a> go into quite a bit of detail comparing various players in the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) space, so I thought it might be time to offer up a description of Notenik features that is equally detailed, without being as lengthy and comprehensive as the Notenik Knowledge Base. The result is a new guide to Notenik&#8217;s features, formatted in a way that makes it easy to compare to some of these other apps. You can find it <a href="https://notenik.app/features/EPUB/html/notenik-features.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> on the website. Feel free to check it out, and recommend it to others.  </p>

<p>So that&#8217;s it for the latest updates! As always, if you have something on your Notenik wish list that is still not there, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app" class="wiki-link">drop me a line</a> and let me know how you think my little app can be further improved. I&#8217;m always happy to entertain suggestions from users. </p>

<p>See the <a href="../knowledge-base/EPUB/html/version-history.html" class="wiki-link">Notenik Version History page</a> for additional details, with links to new and updated pages in the Notenik Knowledge Base. </p>
