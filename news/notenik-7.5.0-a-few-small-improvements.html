				<h3>Notenik 7.5.0 - A Few Small Improvements</h3>
				<p class="news-date">Posted on 28 Oct, 2021</p>

				<div id="content">
					<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s enough to just improve a few things for users, rather than adding a bunch of completely new stuff. </p>

<p>This release adds an Advanced Search function. The new window allows you to opt out of including certain common fields in a search, when you&#8217;re looking for more focused results. It also gives you the option of doing a case-sensitive search. These are not options you need everyday, but it&#8217;s nice to have them there when they&#8217;d be helpful.  </p>

<p>Adding a new menu option made me rethink Notenik&#8217;s overall menu structure, resulting in a couple of changes that should make everything a little easier to navigate. If you&#8217;re looking for sort options, these are now found beneath the Collection menu. Search options, including the new Advanced Search option, are now beneath the new Nav menu, along with a few more navigation options. And the Format menu is now gone, with the <code>Display Appearance</code> option now beneath the App preferences. </p>

<p>This release also adds a new field label and type of <code>Class</code>. The intent here is to have a field that tells Notenik something about the intended role of a particular Note within the overall structure of a Collection. But this is mostly a placeholder for now. Look for future enhancements in coming releases to more fully express my design intent here. </p>

<p>In the meantime, though, the addition of this new field was the proverbial straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back when it came to the Collection Preferences window, so I&#8217;ve reorganized this thing a bit to make it easier to use, and make better use of available screen real estate. </p>

<p>A new user recently noticed that, if you have the Edit tab visible, Notenik allows you to quit the application, or close the window, without saving any in-flight changes you had made. I&#8217;ve fixed this, so Notenik will save your changes automatically in this scenario. </p>

<p>And then, one more slight improvement: when sorting by the Seq field, Notenik will now perform padding on up to six segments (separated by dots or dashes), whereas before it stopped at four. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a Notenik user, then hopefully you will find at least a few of these refinements to be helpful. </p>
