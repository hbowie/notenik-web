				<h3>Notenik at Fifty</h3>
				<p class="news-date">Posted on 16 Jan, 2023</p>

				<div id="content">
					<p>Notenik has just hit fifty &#8211; fifty ratings in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac App Store</a>, that is! &#8211; so I thought this might be an opportune time to reflect a bit on how the app has evolved over the last several years. </p>

<p>First, I&#8217;m happy to report that the average rating is 4.9 out of 5 (and that&#8217;s without ever asking Apple to reset the app&#8217;s score, which is an option offered each time I submit a new version for review). Very cool, I think, and no small source of pride.   </p>

<p>The first release of the current Swift version happened in July of 2019, and we can track the app&#8217;s growth through some of its reviews.  </p>

<p><em>Three</em> years ago, my first review said: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is nothing too special about this program other than you can use the available code to learn how to program using Swift. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So true! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minimum Viable Product</a> goal accomplished! </p>

<p>Then if we fast forward to <em>two</em> years ago, a reviewer said: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I found this app to be very useful. Not only that, the developer is very hands on and responsive. I can highly recommend. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this point I had started to get some feedback about the app from users, and had implemented many improvements based on those comments, usually within a few weeks of their receipt. </p>

<p>And then we can find a review from <em>one</em> year ago: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Great native app. A clean, uncluttered look that is highly useful. The options for your lists and collections are just right &#8211; you get enough options for customization without being too overwhelmed with tons of features. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this time the app had grown quite a bit, with lots of new features, but the initial, basic interface remained nearly unchanged, with all of the controls being very familiar to anyone who has used a Mac for any length of time. </p>

<p>And then, just <em>six months</em> ago: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t say enough good things about Notenik. It&#8217;s a no-frills, yet all the frills note-taking, personal knowledge management/information organization tool. It&#8217;s always being updated and improved and seems to be created and cared for by a great developer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow! Thanks to <code>lorz617</code> for that! I couldn&#8217;t conjure up nicer words in my wildest dreams! </p>

<p>And now, we&#8217;re starting 2023 with a <a href="https://pocketmags.com/us/macformat-magazine/january-2023/articles/1247651/notenik-10" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-page review by Kenny Hemphill</a> in both MacFormat and Mac|Life magazines, rating Notenik as <strong>GREAT</strong>, with a score of 4 out of 5. </p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t be happier. </p>

<p>Back at the start of this journey, in November of 2019, I wrote a piece titled &#8220;<a href="https://hbowie.medium.com/notenik-a-contrarian-mix-of-old-and-new-5cd844d362fa" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik: A Contrarian Mix of Old and New</a>,&#8221; that ended with this bottom line: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I tend to view programming, as well as other forms of writing, as a means of finding out what I really want to say. Notenik is certainly not a perfect app, but it’s a pretty good expression of my intentions to create a Mac app that in many respects is fully modern, but that also carries forward many of the empowering aspects of personal computing that I’ve come to appreciate over the years. </p>

<p>It certainly won’t be for everyone, but I’m hoping that at least a few other people will find it useful. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my perspective, I can say that the contrarian path I charted back then has worked out much as I had hoped, and I&#8217;m also happy to see that my second intention has come to fruition, with a few others finding it useful as well. </p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has used the app, <a href="https://discourse.notenik.app" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submitted feedback</a>, rated the app and/or reviewed it. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://notenik.app" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik</a> journey is not done yet, but I have to say I&#8217;m pretty happy with the state of our progress so far. </p>
