				<h1>About</h1>

				<div id="content">
					<p>I&#8217;m <a href="https://hbowie.net/about.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herb Bowie</a>, and I&#8217;m the author of Notenik. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been programming for quite some time now, and I&#8217;ve also been an avid Mac user for many years. </p>

<p>My first foray into object-oriented programming was through Java. I wrote several different desktop programs in that language, and over time most of them morphed into a single application, which I ended up calling Notenik. </p>

<p>A few years ago now, several things happened that together convinced me to rewrite Notenik in a new language. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>I retired from my corporate job, which meant I no longer had a personal interest in writing software that I could use on Windows, as well as on a Mac. </p></li>
<li><p>Apple&#8217;s support for Java became less and less enthusiastic. </p></li>
<li><p>Oracle became less supportive of desktop applications written in Java. </p></li>
<li><p>Apple introduced a new programming language, Swift, that gradually matured into a stable, useful programming tool. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>And so the current version of Notenik that I&#8217;m describing on this site is written entirely in Swift, and runs solely on the Mac. </p>

<p>My motivations for writing Notenik are three-fold: </p>
<ol>
<li>For my own personal use.  <br />
</li>
<li>For my own enjoyment &#8211; the truth is, I really like programming. </li>
<li>I want to make something that other people find useful. </li>
</ol>

<p>Based on these motivations, Notenik is available for free, and is available as open-source software. </p>

<p>Notenik is available exclusively through the Mac App Store. And although I realize that many developers have had lots of problems using that distribution channel, my experiences with it have all been positive, and I&#8217;m grateful to have something available to me and my users that is relatively safe and painless, and that requires no payments from users. </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy using Notenik, and I&#8217;d be happy to <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app" class="wiki-link">hear from you</a> if you have any comments or suggestions for improvement. </p>

<h2 id="about-those-other-names...">About Those Other Names&#8230;</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m also the owner of the domain name powersurgepub.com, and have &#8220;PowerSurge Publishing&#8221; registered in the US state of Washington as a Trade Name (sometimes known as a &#8220;DBA&#8221;, for &#8220;Doing Business As&#8221;). </p>

<p>In the past I operated PowerSurgePub.com as its own website, where you could find a number of desktop apps I&#8217;d written in Java over a period of years, including the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Club Planner </li>
<li>HeadOut </li>
<li>iWisdom </li>
<li>Link Tweaker </li>
<li>Notenik (a version written in Java) </li>
<li>PSExplorer </li>
<li>PSRenamer </li>
<li>PSTextMerge </li>
<li>Tunes Checker </li>
<li>Two Due </li>
<li>URL Union </li>
</ul>

<p>The functionality of many of the Java programs listed above has been folded into the new Notenik, now written in Swift, and described on this site, Notenik.app. </p>

<p>At this point I am no longer maintaining any of the Java apps listed above, and am no longer maintaining PowerSurgePub.com as a separate website. </p>
