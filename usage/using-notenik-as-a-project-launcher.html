				<h2>Using Notenik as a Project Launcher</h2>
				<p class="news-date">Posted on 26 Oct, 2022</p>

				<div id="content">
					<p><img src="../images/notenik-project-launcher.jpg" alt="Notenik Screenshot" /> </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started using my own Mac app Notenik as a project launcher lately, and I wanted to share how I&#8217;ve set this up, in case someone else might benefit from it. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try to break this down into a rough sequence of separate steps, to make it easier to understand, but you don&#8217;t necessarily need to do all of this in any strict progression.  </p>

<section id="section-for-1-set-notenik-to-request-access-at-startup">

<h4 id="1-set-notenik-to-request-access-at-startup">1. Set Notenik to Request Access at Startup</h4>

<p>Notenik does not require Full Disk Access, and it is not set to request it. But if you want to use Notenik to its fullest as a project launcher, you might want to give it broad access to your files and folders. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the way I do this. In the Notenik Application Preferences, I set the <strong>General Pref</strong> of <strong>Grant Access</strong> to the value <strong>At Startup</strong>. Then whenever I launch Notenik (something I usually do once at the start of each day), Notenik will prompt me to select a folder to which it should have access. I then select my top-level user folder &#8211; <em>hbowie</em>, in my case &#8211; and click <strong>Grant Access</strong>. From that point on, Notenik will have access to anything in my user folder, and I won&#8217;t have to worry about any of my launch requests being thwarted due to lack of fresh permissions. </p>

<p>As an alternative to setting this as a Notenik preference, you can just use the <strong>Grant Folder Access</strong> menu item at any point later to accomplish the same thing. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-2-set-up-your-project-launcher">

<h4 id="2-set-up-your-project-launcher">2. Set Up Your Project Launcher </h4>

<p>Create a <strong>New Collection</strong>. You can store it wherever you like, but I placed mine in the <strong>Notenik folder within iCloud Drive</strong>, just to make it easy to access. You can initialize it as a <strong>Sequenced List</strong>. However you initialize it, though, make sure the <strong>Link</strong>, <strong>Seq</strong> and <strong>Level</strong> fields are selected in your <strong>Collection Preferences</strong>, and then use <strong>Collection > Sort</strong> to sequence your list by <strong>Seq + Title</strong>. Name it however you like, but I called mine <em>Project Launcher</em>, just to show that I had no fear of the obvious. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-3-make-the-project-launcher-essential">

<h4 id="3-make-the-project-launcher-essential">3. Make the Project Launcher Essential</h4>

<p>Use <strong>File > Make This Collection Essential</strong> so that it automatically opens for you whenever you launch Notenik. I then position it in the upper left corner of my screen. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-4-add-things-you-want-to-work-on">

<h4 id="4-add-things-you-want-to-work-on">4. Add Things You Want to Work On</h4>

<p>Now start adding notes to your project launcher collection, with each note containing a <strong>Link</strong> to something you might want to work on. </p>

<p>As a reminder, once you&#8217;ve set a <strong>Link</strong> for a note, you only have to double-click on the row for that note in the <strong>List</strong> tab, in order to have Notenik launch that link for you.  </p>

<p>As you add notes, you can use the <strong>Seq</strong> field to keep things in whatever order is most meaningful for you, and use the <strong>Level</strong> field as needed to indent sub-items beneath a meaningful heading. </p>

<p>As you add items to your project launcher, consider all of the different <em>kinds</em> of things that Notenik can launch for you. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-5-web-locations">

<h4 id="5-web-locations">5. Web Locations</h4>

<p>Starting with the most obvious, you can stash a web URL in a <strong>Link</strong> field, in order to later open that site/page. (One easy way to do this is to drag a URL from your web browser&#8217;s <strong>Location/Search</strong> field into the <strong>List</strong> tab for your collection.) </p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like one or more web locations to automatically launch when your <em>Project Launcher</em> collection is opened, just give them <strong>Tags</strong> values of <em>Launch at Startup</em>. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-6-other-notenik-collections">

<h4 id="6-other-notenik-collections">6. Other Notenik Collections</h4>

<p>You can also store the URL to another Notenik collection within a note&#8217;s <strong>Link</strong> field. </p>

<p>For example, I have a collection titled <em>To Do</em> that is also stored in the <em>Notenik</em> folder within my <em>iCloud Drive</em>. This collection has a <strong>Date</strong> field and a <strong>Recurs</strong> field and a <strong>Status</strong> field, and I use it to keep track of things I need to do on a regular basis, or on some specific date. </p>

<p>This used to be my <strong>Essential Collection</strong>, but it now sits at the top of my <em>Project Launcher</em>, with a <strong>Seq</strong> value of 1. </p>

<p>So I can just double-click on this first row to see a reminder of scheduled tasks that are due today. </p>

<p>Adding another Notenik collection to your project launcher can be done with three easy steps. </p>
<ul>
<li>Open the collection that you wish to target; </li>
<li>Under the <strong>Collection</strong> menu, select the option to <strong>Copy Notenik URL for Collection</strong>; </li>
<li>Back in your project launcher, add a new note, and then use the <strong>Paste</strong> command in the <strong>Link</strong> field to capture the Notenik URL you copied in the prior step. </li>
</ul>

<p>Now all you have to do is double-click that item in your project launcher collection to open that other collection. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-7-custom-url-actions">

<h4 id="7-custom-url-actions">7. Custom URL Actions</h4>

<p>Notenik, as well as many other Mac apps, have what are known as <em>Custom URL Schemes</em>, in which the name of the app appears at the beginning of the URL, instead of the usual <code>https</code>. You can use a launcher note to fire off any of these custom URL actions for Notenik or for any other app. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-8-local-files">

<h4 id="8-local-files">8. Local Files</h4>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve created a new note, and while you&#8217;re still on the <strong>Edit</strong> tab, you can use <strong>Set Local Link</strong> beneath the <strong>Note</strong> menu to pick a local file that you wish to be opened by the new note. For example, selecting an Xcode project file will cause that Xcode project to be opened when the Link is launched. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-9-notenik-parent-realms">

<h4 id="9-notenik-parent-realms">9. Notenik Parent Realms</h4>

<p>A <em>Parent Realm</em> in Notenik is simply an ordinary folder containing, possibly within subfolders, one or more resources that Notenik might be interested in, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Notenik collections; </li>
<li>Notenik scripts; </li>
<li><a href="https://bbedit-guide.netlify.app/02-projects/index.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBEdit project files</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>So, within the context of this project launcher discussion, a parent realm is a neat way to further organize your projects. </p>

<p>To create a launcher Note for a parent realm, start by using the <strong>Open Parent Realm</strong> command beneath the <strong>File</strong> menu, and then specify a folder containing one or more of the types of items identified above. You will then see the folder open as a sort of pseudo-collection, in its own window. From there you can invoke <strong>Copy Note for Collection</strong>, just as we described above for an ordinary collection, and then paste the resulting <strong>Link</strong> into a new note within your project launcher. </p>

<p>In my case, many of my projects are websites that I&#8217;ve created, with each folder containing the generated HTML, as well as Notenik collections, scripts and merge templates. So I store each website project folder as a separate item to be launched within my project launcher. Then, once I&#8217;ve opened the parent realm for a project, I can proceed to open items within that parent realm. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-10-bbedit-project-files">

<h4 id="10-bbedit-project-files">10. BBEdit Project Files</h4>

<p>I mentioned above that Notenik will help you open BBEdit project files found within a parent realm. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the way I use this. </p>

<p>For each of my major projects (ones that I will be launching as parent realms), I use BBEdit to create a new project file, save it at the top level of my parent realm folder, then drag and drop my project folder onto the left side of the BBEdit project window. </p>

<p>Now when I open a parent realm from my launcher I&#8217;ll see a BBEdit project file listed, and can double-click on that to open  the entire project folder in BBEdit. Then, if I later request from Notenik to <strong>Text Edit</strong> a note or a collection template file, that file will open within the BBEdit project window. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-11-opening-folders-in-the-finder">

<h4 id="11-opening-folders-in-the-finder">11. Opening Folders in the Finder</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that, once you have opened a parent realm (or a simple collection, for that matter), you can ask Notenik to open the corresponding folder in the macOS Finder by using <strong>Open Folder in Finder</strong> beneath the <strong>File</strong> menu. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-12-putting-it-all-together">

<h4 id="12-putting-it-all-together">12. Putting It All Together</h4>

<p>So here&#8217;s how I use all of this. </p>

<p>When I launch Notenik, it automatically requests appropriate disk access, and I give it permission to access my entire user folder. </p>

<p>Notenik then automatically opens my project launcher and positions it in the upper left corner of my screen. I then leave it there for the rest of the day, and come back to it each time I&#8217;m switching projects. </p>

<p>My project launcher lists all the things I might want to work on, with each note generally pointing to a parent realm (aka project folder) for that project. </p>

<p>When I switch my attention from one project to another, I close the windows I&#8217;ve opened for the old project, and then open the parent realm window for the new project. That window then usually sits with its upper left corner just below and to the right of the upper left corner for my project launcher. </p>

<p>From there I can open Notenik collections, run scripts, open the folder in BBEdit and the Finder. </p>

<p>And then start to get work done on the new project. </p>

<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s all working pretty well for me, so I thought I would share. </p>
