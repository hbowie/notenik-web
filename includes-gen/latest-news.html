								Notenik 7.7.0 - Class Templates are Introduced
							</a>
						</h3>

						<p>This release introduces Class templates. Each different Class value within a Collection can have its own template, and that template can limit the fields included on the Edit tab for Notes of that Class, and can also supply default values for any fields that are included. This is one of those features that can be used in lots of different ways, for many different purposes, so it's worth sitting down and having a good think about how you might be able to put this feature to use for your Notes. </p>
