				<h1>Adventures with Notenik</h1>
				<h3>What Makes Notenik Different? Collection Templates</h3>
				<p class="news-date">Adventure # 42 &bull;  Thursday, February 6, 2025</p>
				<div id="content">
					<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to figure out what makes Notenik different from all the other note-taking, Markdown-parsing, text-file-wrangling apps out there. </p>

<p>So let&#8217;s start with the most significant, core differentiator: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each folder of text files managed by Notenik has its own unique <em>template</em> file&#8230; </p></li>
<li><p>And each template file defines a set of <em>fields</em> for the notes within that folder&#8230; </p></li>
<li><p>And each field is defined by a <em>label</em>, a <em>type</em>, and (sometimes) a <em>configuration</em>&#8230; </p></li>
<li><p>And the file extension for the template file specifies the file extension to be used for notes created within that folder. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example of how this works in practice. </p>

<p>Here are the contents of a sample template file, which is just an ordinary text file that you can open with your favorite text editor. Here I&#8217;m using BBEdit. </p>

<p><img src="../images/sample-template-file.png" alt="Sample template file, viewed within BBEdit" /> </p>

<p>And here&#8217;s what the <em>Edit</em> tab will look like when adding a new note to the collection (aka <em>folder</em>) using this template. </p>

<p><img src="../images/sample-edit-window.png" alt="The Edit Tab within Notenik" /> </p>

<p>So let me just point out a few interesting bits here: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every note must start with a Title field, and conclude with a Body field (although they can be given different labels). </p></li>
<li><p>In between those two, a note can have many different fields, of many different types. </p></li>
<li><p>The field type will, among other things, determine what sort of widget appears on the <em>Edit</em> tab for that field, when adding a new note within that folder, or when editing an existing note. </p></li>
<li><p>Some field types, such as <em>status</em>, can also have a configuration specified in the template. In this case, the allowable status values are being specified, and these are the values that will appear in the drop-down menu when selecting a value for this field. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So here&#8217;s what a sample note might look like after being added to this collection, and when viewed on Notenik&#8217;s <em>Display</em> tab. </p>

<p><img src="../images/sample-display-tab.png" alt="The Display Tab within Notenik" /> </p>

<p>And, just to round things out, and remove the last bit of mystery, here&#8217;s what the resulting note file might look like (again viewing with BBEdit). </p>

<p><img src="../images/sample-note-file.png" alt="Sample note file" /> </p>

<p>And then, perhaps, I should make one final point for today&#8217;s <em>Adventure</em> post. </p>

<p>One may always edit a Notenik template file directly, if one is so inclined, and this is sometimes the best way to build some new and exotic sort of collection. </p>

<p>However, direct editing of the template file is generally a last resort, and Notenik offers these other ways of tailoring a template file, before resorting to direct editing. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>When creating a new collection, Notenik currently offers sixteen different <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/starting-collection-types.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starting Collection Types</a> from which you may choose, each with a different collection template. Even when creating something new, you can help yourself by picking a good starting point from this list.  </p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Collection Settings</em> window allows you to pick from several common field labels and types in order to add them to your collection template. </p></li>
<li><p>After initial creation, Notenik offers a handy window to <em>Rename, Add or Remove</em> a field, available beneath the <em>Collection</em> menu. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s generally best to exercise these options to get you as far as possible, and then perform direct editing of your template file to implement any final tweaks. </p>

<p>Hopefully this post has helped to explain one of the key ways in which Notenik differs from other similar apps. </p>

<p>Now, as to <em>why</em> Notenik works this way&#8230;? </p>

<p>Well, when creating a list of items, with each row containing a number of columns, I often wished to have one or more columns containing some significant amount of text&#8230; but then a traditional spreadsheet app quickly gets awkward and unwieldy. </p>

<p>And then when writing some significant chunks of text, I often wished to organize many such chunks into a coherent collection, and then sort, filter and format those chunks using some set of discrete fields, in addition to the more free-form bits of text&#8230; but then a traditional document editing app proves disappointing. </p>

<p>So Notenik attempts to provide a happy medium in between these two extremes, and the collection template file is the key to pulling this all together. </p>
