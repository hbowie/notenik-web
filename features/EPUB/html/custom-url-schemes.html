<h3 id="custom-url-schemes">18. Custom URL Schemes</h3>
<p>Notenik has its own custom URL scheme, meaning that you can type a URL starting with <code>notenik://</code>, followed by a valid Notenik command, and then, by following that link from another application, can get Notenik to do something for you: open a Collection, open a particular Note, add a new Note, etc. </p>
<p>Notenik also provides menu commands to easily generate custom URLs linking to selected Notes within a Notenik Collection. </p>
<p>Notenik also has a special Link field, and you can use that to fire off custom URLs for other apps &#8211; or, for Notenik itself, for that matter. </p>
