<h3 id="a-personal-content-management-system">9. A Personal Content Management System</h3>
<p>This seems as good a time as any to make a small confession. I have a lot of history working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> systems, and also with web <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management systems</a>, such as <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>. So when I originally started writing Notenik, several things seemed very natural to me: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thinking of a Note as an object, or an entity, or a row in a table, or a record. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking of every value associated with a Note as having its own field name (aka label, or column heading). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having different types of fields available, each with its own intended usage and functionality. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different Collections of Notes each having their own sets of associated field names and types. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And so, in some ways, Notenik is as much a small, text-based, personal database application (akin to the early versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker">FileMaker</a>) as it is anything else. </p>
<p>Keeping this lineage in mind may help you understand some of the thinking behind Notenik, and some of its potential uses, as you continue with your exploration of the product. </p>
