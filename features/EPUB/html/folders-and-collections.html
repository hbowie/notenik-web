<h3 id="folders-and-collections">4. Folders and Collections</h3>
<p>Unlike some systems, Notenik does not expect or require you to keep all of your notes in a singular location, sometimes referred to as a <em>vault</em>. </p>
<p>With Notenik, a folder full of Notes is referred to as a <em>Collection</em>, and you can have as many of these as you like, and store them wherever you would like. </p>
