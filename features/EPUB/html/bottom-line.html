<p>Notenik is admittedly not for everyone, and it is not intended to be. </p>
<p>There are lots of good reasons to choose one of the other apps that share this note-taking space. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;ve received lots of positive feedback about Notenik, and so I think others might wish to give it fair consideration before choosing an app for their own use. </p>
