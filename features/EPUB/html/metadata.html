<h3 id="metadata">7. Metadata</h3>
<p>The ability to smartly handle metadata (that is, data about a note, in addition to the note text itself) is a distinguishing feature of most advanced note-taking systems these days. </p>
<p>Somewhat unfortunately, perhaps, the ways in which this sort of data is specified can vary quite a bit from one implementation to another. </p>
<p>In general, though, metadata is specified at the top of a note file, via a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nameâ€“value_pair">name-value pairs</a>, as in the following example: </p>

<code>Title:  Notenik Wins Again!

about Notenik, written with scrupulous honesty by 
its own author.

<p>Given this starting point, though, there are a couple of significant variations. </p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/metadata.html">MultiMarkdown Metadata</a>, which has been around quite a while. </p>
<p>Then, of more recent popularity, there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> frontmatter. </p>
<p>And, if left to its own devices, Notenik will use yet a different variation on this same theme. </p>
<p>Notenik, however, will do its best to recognize, honor and respect any of these three slightly different systems. </p>
<p>The bottom line here is that you can enter metadata to your heart&#8217;s content and, if you already have text files containing some sort of metadata as described above, there is a good chance Notenik will work just fine with your existing text files and metadata formats. </p>
