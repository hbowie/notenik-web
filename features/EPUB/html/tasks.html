<h3 id="tasks">17. Tasks</h3>
<p>Notenik supports the creation of a list of tasks within a Note, using the common Markdown extension for <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#task-lists">Task Lists</a>. </p>
<p>More functionality is available, however, if each task is represented by a separate Note. You can then use a Date field to track a due date, or a completion date, and can use a Status field to track each task&#8217;s status, and a Seq field, if you like, to track a task&#8217;s priority. </p>
<p>You can also sort such a Task list by Date or by Priority, with completed tasks falling to the bottom of the list. </p>
