<p>Notenik is, rather unapologetically, a Mac App. It is available only on macOS. So if your primary note-taking device is something other than a Mac, then Notenik will not be for you. </p>
<p>(Although I will point out that the Mac has been undergoing quite a resurgence lately, so if you were ever thinking about switching, most observers agree that <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">now might be a good time</a>.) </p>
