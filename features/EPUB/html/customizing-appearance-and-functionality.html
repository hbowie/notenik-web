<p>Some comparable apps offer the ability to tailor the look, feel and/or functionality of their apps using plug-ins. These are sometimes written using the Javascript language. </p>
<p>Notenik does not offer any ability to add plug-ins written in Javascript, or in any other language. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the look and feel of the app can be tailored somewhat via Application and Collection Preferences and Display preferences, and the functionality for a Collection can be modified through the inclusion of one or more of a variety of special field types. </p>
<p>Both light and dark modes are supported. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, you can also write and supply your own custom CSS to change the appearance of your Notes on the Display tab. </p>
