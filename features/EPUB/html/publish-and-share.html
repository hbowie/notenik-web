<p>Notenik offers many different ways to format and share a single Note, or an entire Collection. </p>
<p>In general, you can choose to keep your content in Markdown, or convert it to HTML (the language used by Web browsers to display pages). </p>
<p>You can also choose a single Note, or just the Body of a Note. </p>
<p>You can also format an entire Collection to be shared as a single, large document, or as a folder full of connected web pages. </p>
<p>For the greatest degree of customization, you can use built-in templating and scripting languages to create entire websites, including complex index pages. </p>
