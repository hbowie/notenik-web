<p>You can create headings at any level by placing that number of <code>#</code> characters at the beginning of a line. </p>

<p>For example, this would produce a level 3 heading. </p>

<pre><code>### Level 3 Heading
</code></pre>

<p>And here&#8217;s our sample unordered list. </p>

<pre><code>+ Bread
+ Sugar
+ Hole
</code></pre>

<p>And here&#8217;s what this would look like. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bread </li>
<li>Sugar </li>
<li>Hole </li>
</ul>

<p>And here&#8217;s an ordered list, first in code, and then rendered as HTML. </p>

<pre><code>1. **Portable Happiness:** Donuts are the perfect grab-and-go food. You can take them anywhere: to work, to the park, or on a road trip. They’re like little circles of happiness that fit in your hand.
2. **Instant Mood Boost:** Feeling down? Have a donut. It’s scientifically proven\* that donuts can turn a frown upside down. (\*Not actually proven, but we all know it’s true.)
3. **Endless Creativity:** Donut shops are constantly coming up with new and exciting flavors. From maple bacon to matcha green tea, the possibilities are endless. It’s like a delicious adventure every time you visit.

<p>One thing to point out here is that we had to use a  backslash before each asterisk in the second item to prevent those asterisks from being interpreted as part of our Markdown syntax. This is called a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#backslash" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backslash escape</a>. </p>

<p>Markdown also allows you to nest one list within another, simply by indenting the lower-level list with four leading spaces, or one leading tab character. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example in code. </p>

<pre><code>+ First main point
	+ Sub point
	+ Another sub-point
+ Second main point
	+ Sub point
	+ Another sub-point
</code></pre>

<p>And here&#8217;s how it will render. </p>
<ul>
<li>First main point 
<ul>
<li>Sub point </li>
<li>Another sub-point </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second main point 
<ul>
<li>Sub point </li>
<li>Another sub-point </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
