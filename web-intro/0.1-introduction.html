<p>Start by reading the <a href="https://www.htmlforpeople.com/intro/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML for people Introduction</a>. </p>

<p>I agree entirely with Blake&#8217;s points about HTML simply being the document format for the web, and something that everyone should have some familiarity with. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll go a little further, though. </p>

<p>Many of the modern technologies we use are entirely flat and opaque. We are presented with a nice-looking user interface, with no ability at all to peer beneath the surface to see what&#8217;s going on below, no ability to actually <em>understand</em> how something works, no ability to conceptualize how things might be tweaked or rearranged to make them into something new, something better, something more suited to our needs. </p>

<p>But, thankfully, HTML and the web are different. </p>

<p>All of the websites we see, all of the digital content we consume, is created using HTML. </p>

<p>But HTML, as we will see, can be used to create very small, simple (but still satisfying!) things, as well as very complex things, </p>

<p>But the basic building blocks are all the same. </p>

<p>And so, once we understand some of the basics, it allows us to create our own things, but also empowers us as digital citizens, because we now know a little more about how the things around us are being put together. </p>

<h4 id="who-is-this-book-for">Who is this book for?</h4>

<p>This companion is aimed at the same audience as Blake&#8217;s, with the caveat that only Mac users can make use of Notenik. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-what-do-i-need">

<h4 id="what-do-i-need">What do I need?</h4>

<p>You need a <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac</a> with internet access, and a copy of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik</a> downloaded and installed on your Mac. </p>

<p>If this is your first experience with Notenik, then it may help to orient yourself to the app&#8217;s operation by viewing the <a href="https://youtu.be/JR0kpAUXM5E?si=rIkuQHWtj4YbCOd6" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik 101 video</a>, which will only take a few minutes. </p>

<h4 id="how-to-proceed">How to proceed</h4>

<p>Note that there are two ways to use the <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML for People</a> book while working your way through this companion document. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Read each chapter of Blake&#8217;s book as it is referenced, gaining a growing understanding of how HTML works, then read the corresponding chapter of this companion document, and work through the actions described herein. </p></li>
<li><p>Actually work through the instructions given in both Blake&#8217;s book and this companion document. In this case, you will be building two separate websites, in two separate folders. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think either of these approaches can work. Your choice! </p>
