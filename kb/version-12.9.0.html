<h5 id="improvements-to-file-links">Improvements to File Links</h5>

<p>The Set Local Link command was not working correctly to set <a href="file-links.html" class="wiki-link">File Links</a>. This has been corrected. </p>

<p>In addition, a note with a local link can now be created by dragging a file (something like a PDF) onto the List tab for a Collection, then dropping the file after an existing row. The new Note&#8217;s Title will be based on the name of the file dropped, and will contain a link to the file.  </p>

<p>Also, a new command beneath the Note menu will Convert a Local Link to an Attachment, if the user would prefer to access the external file in that manner. </p>

<p>The <a href="wiki-style-links-w.html" class="wiki-link">Wiki-Style Links Mod</a> has been enhanced to recognize <a href="wiki-links-between-collections.html" class="wiki-link">Wiki Links Between Collections</a>, and to handle them in such a way that these links can still work reliably when generating HTML output pages for a website. </p>

<section id="section-for-added-export-to-html-outline-option">

<section id="section-for-fixed-level-1-headings-beginning-with-digits">

<h5 id="fixed-level-1-headings-beginning-with-digits">Fixed Level 1 Headings Beginning with Digits</h5>

<p>The number sign (&#8216;#&#8217;) can have multiple meanings. When 1 - 6 of these symbols are placed at the beginning of a line, then Markdown interprets the line as a heading. But this symbol can also be used as part of ordinary writing to indicate that a number follows. Previously, when a line started with one of these symbols, and was followed by a space, but the space was then followed by a digit, the Notenik Markdown parser interpreted this as an attempt to identify the digit(s) as a number, rather than indicating a level 1 heading. The parser has now been modified to only make this assumption (number sign rather than heading indicator) when the symbol is <em>not</em> immediately followed by a space. </p>
