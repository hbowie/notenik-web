<p>With an embedded collection template you can easily create simple website with informations, pages, news and other content. </p>

<p>You may use the <a href="website.html" class="wiki-link">Website</a> template when you are <a href="create-a-new-collection.html" class="wiki-link">Creating and Tailoring a Collection of Notes</a> and Notenik will create a simple blog. It may be divided to three important parts: </p>
<ol>
<li>Collection with content (in Contents directory) It contains preconfigured collection with all website contents in separate notes.  <br />
</li>
<li>Necessary templates, factory files and scripts for making the website (in Factory directory). These files and templates can export notes to a standalone website. </li>
<li>Output folder with website itself (in Web directory), in which you find prepared website as generation result. </li>
</ol>

<p>Your collection contains preconfigured <a href="the-collection-template-file.html" class="wiki-link">The Collection Template File</a> with initial set of <a href="web-making-fields.html" class="wiki-link">Web-Making Fields</a> and predefined <a href="merge-templates.html" class="wiki-link">Merge Templates</a>,  CSS styles for web design and <a href="script-files.html" class="wiki-link">Script Files</a> for generating website from notes. Here is a summarized description of how it works: </p>
<ol>
<li>You create content by <a href="add-delete-and-edit-your-notes.html" class="wiki-link">Add, Delete and Edit Your Notes</a> in collections. There are important fields as <a href="title.html" class="wiki-link">Title</a> as page title, <a href="date.html" class="wiki-link">Date</a> as publish date and <a href="body.html" class="wiki-link">Body</a> as page content. Be aware, <a href="date-added.html" class="wiki-link">Date added</a> and <a href="date-modified.html" class="wiki-link">Date modified</a> do not affect publish date of pages. </li>
<li>There are some prepared <a href="merge-templates.html" class="wiki-link">Merge Templates</a> to design and generate every HTML page from original notes using Output command. You may edit these templates to suit design and content to your needs. </li>
<li>By running &#8220;web-gen.tcz&#8221; script in &#8220;Factory&#8221; subdirectory you run generating whole website. Default output directory is &#8220;Web&#8221;, you may modify it by editing Output command in all desired templates in &#8220;Factory/Templates&#8221; subdirectory. </li>
<li>Script generates HTML file for each note using desired template and include HTML and other files included in these templates. For example, there is <a href="include-command.html" class="wiki-link">include command</a> to include header of site (including &#8220;Factory/Includes/header.html&#8221;), footer of site (including &#8220;Factory/Includes/footer.html&#8221;) and HEAD contents and styles links for each page (including &#8220;Factory/Includes/head-links.html&#8221;). If script generates prepared parts of content, there are stored in &#8220;Factory/includes-gen&#8221; directory and these parts can by included by other templates. </li>
<li>You must upload whole website directory as-is to your hosting provider or you can open &#8220;index.html&#8221; file to preview it. </li>
</ol>

<p>For linking within the website, you may use Classic <a href="wiki-style-links.html" class="wiki-link">Wiki Style Links</a> as the simplest way to implement <a href="fields-to-assist-with-note-linking.html" class="wiki-link">Connections Between Notes</a>. Wiki links work as expected, but Back links does not work as referencing point in output. It is usefull to determine and use <a href="short-id.html" class="wiki-link">Short ID</a> in some situations, for example for scripting. </p>
