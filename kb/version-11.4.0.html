<p>Date: 30 Jan 2023 - Monday</p><section id="section-for-a-seq-field-can-now-be-used-to-store-a-time-of-day">

<h5 id="a-seq-field-can-now-be-used-to-store-a-time-of-day">A Seq Field Can Now Be Used to Store a Time of Day</h5>

<p>The logic for the <a href="seq.html" class="wiki-link">Seq</a> field has been modified to accommodate its use as a time of day. This can be handy when used in combination with a <a href="date.html" class="wiki-link">Date</a> field. You can then sort a Collection by Date + Seq and see things sort into the expected sequence, and display as expected. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-menu-reorganization">

<h5 id="menu-reorganization">Menu Reorganization</h5>

<p>Notenik now sports a new menu titled <strong>Query</strong>. This is the place to find actions that will manipulate a Collection in order to produce some sort of combined output in HTML. The output HTML can be viewed internally within a Notenik window, or viewed externally, within a web browser. </p>

<p>The <a href="query-builder.html" class="wiki-link">Query Builder</a> item has been moved here. You will also now find the <a href="favorites-to-html.html" class="wiki-link">Favorites to HTML</a> function here (now simply called <strong>Favorites</strong>). And the new <a href="dates-to-calendar.html" class="wiki-link">Dates to Calendar</a> function (see below) can also be found here. </p>

<p>Additionally, the <strong>Transform</strong> menu was moved to the right of the <strong>View</strong> menu. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-expanded-use-of-query-output-window">

<h5 id="expanded-use-of-query-output-window">Expanded Use of Query Output Window</h5>

<p>The <a href="query-builder.html" class="wiki-link">Query Builder</a> previously sent its output to an internal <a href="query-output-window.html" class="wiki-link">Query Output Window</a>. The new <a href="dates-to-calendar.html" class="wiki-link">Dates to Calendar</a> function also sends its output to this same window (although with a suitably differentiated title). And the <a href="favorites-to-html.html" class="wiki-link">Favorites to HTML</a> function now also sends its output to this same window. </p>

<p>In all cases, this window now has a pull-down button, titled <strong>Web Page</strong>, in the lower right corner, from which any of the following actions can be selected: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Save to Disk&#8230;</strong> </p>

<p>This function allows the user to select a folder and file name to which the output HTML will be saved. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Browse</strong> </p>

<p>This function saves the HTML to a temporary location, and then sends a request to macOS to open this file in the user&#8217;s default Web browser. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Save and Browse&#8230;</strong> </p>

<p>This function allows the user to select a folder and file name, saves the HTML to that location, and then sends a request to macOS to open this saved file in the user&#8217;s default Web browser. </p></li>
</ol>

</section>

<section id="section-for-knowledge-base-reorganization">

<h5 id="knowledge-base-reorganization">Knowledge Base Reorganization</h5>

<p>The Knowledge Base has been reorganized a bit. The section on &#8220;Getting Data Into and Out of Notenik&#8221; has been moved behind the two other sections discussing &#8220;Markdown&#8221; and &#8220;Field Labels and Types.&#8221; And a new &#8220;Integration&#8221; section has been broken out. And a few other smaller changes have been made as well. </p>

</section>

<section id="section-for-new-function-to-generate-a-calendar">

<h5 id="new-function-to-generate-a-calendar">New Function to Generate a Calendar</h5>

<p>A new item beneath the <strong>Query</strong> menu, titled <a href="dates-to-calendar.html" class="wiki-link">Dates to Calendar</a>, allows you to generate a traditional monthly calendar from one or more Notes within a Collection. The Collection must have a <a href="date.html" class="wiki-link">Date</a> field and must be sorted by Date. </p>
