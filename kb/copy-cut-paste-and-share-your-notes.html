<p>There are several different actions you can perform with individual notes. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Copy - Use the Copy command beneath the Edit menu to copy the currently selected Note to the system clipboard. </p></li>
<li><p>Cut - Use the Cut command beneath the Edit menu to copy the currently selected Note to the system clipboard, and then delete the selected Note. </p></li>
<li><p>Paste - Use the Paste command beneath the Edit menu to paste a copied or cut Note into the same or a different Collection (or into an email, or any other destination capable of receiving text). </p></li>
<li><p>Duplicate - Use the Duplicate Note command beneath the Note menu to duplicate the currently selected Note within the same Collection. </p></li>
<li><p>Share via Toolbar - Use the Share command on the Toolbar to send an entire Note to any of several different destinations (Mail, Message, etc.) </p></li>
<li><p>Drag and Drop - When two Collections are open, the user may drag a Note from the List view of one Collection to the List view of a second Collection and drop it there. The Note will be added to the second Collection, and will still remain in its original Collection. </p></li>
<li><p>Share w/Options menu command - See the <a href="share-with-options.html" class="wiki-link">Share with Options</a> page for details. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Be aware that the user should be on the Display Tab, and not the Edit tab, in order to perform cut/copy/paste functions since, when on the Edit tab, cut/copy/paste will typically apply to the text within a field, and not to the entire note. </p>

<p>When dragging a Note from one Collection, and dropping it on the List tab of another Collection, Notenik will now copy any attachments for the Note, in addition to the Note itself. </p>

<p>Other means of copying a Note from one Collection to another may not result in attachments being copied along with the Note. </p>

<p>When copying notes from one Collection to another, any fields present in the first Collection but not in the second will be dropped. </p>
