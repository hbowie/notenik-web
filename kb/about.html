<p>A little about me, and about the history of Notenik. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m <a href="https://hbowie.net/about.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herb Bowie</a>, and I&#8217;m the author of Notenik. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been programming for quite some time now, and I&#8217;ve also been an avid Mac user for many years. </p>

<p>My first foray into object-oriented programming was through Java. I wrote several different desktop programs in that language, and over time most of them morphed into a single application, which I ended up calling Notenik. </p>

<p>A few years ago now, several things happened that together convinced me to rewrite Notenik in a new language. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>I retired from my corporate job, which meant I no longer had a personal interest in writing software that I could use on Windows, as well as on a Mac. </p></li>
<li><p>Apple&#8217;s support for Java became less and less enthusiastic. </p></li>
<li><p>Oracle became less supportive of desktop applications written in Java. </p></li>
<li><p>Apple introduced a new programming language, Swift, that gradually matured into a stable, useful programming tool. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>And so the current version of Notenik that I&#8217;m describing in this Knowledge Base is written entirely in Swift, and runs solely on the Mac. </p>

<p>My motivations for writing Notenik are three-fold: </p>
<ol>
<li>For my own personal use.  <br />
</li>
<li>For my own enjoyment &#8211; the truth is, I really like programming. </li>
<li>I want to make something that other people find useful. </li>
</ol>

<p>Based on these motivations, Notenik is available for free, and is available as open-source software. </p>

<p>Notenik is available exclusively through the Mac App Store. And although I realize that many developers have had lots of problems using that distribution channel, my experiences with it have all been positive, and I&#8217;m grateful to have something available to me and my users that is relatively safe and painless, and that requires no payments from users. </p>
