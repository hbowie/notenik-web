<h5 id="single-children-now-listed-within-streamlined-contents">Single Children now Listed within Streamlined Contents</h5>

<p>When the Display Mode in the <a href="collection-settings.html" class="wiki-link">Collection Settings</a> has been changed to <em>Streamlined</em> or <em>Presentation</em>, then a <em>Contents</em> section will be generated at the bottom of the <em>Display</em>, if the note being displayed has any children. The previous behavior was to only generate this <em>Contents</em> list if it would contain more than one child; this has now been changed to generated the <em>Contents</em> list for any number of children, including the case of a list showing only a single child. </p>

<section id="section-for-improved-ampersand-handling-in-titles">

<h5 id="improved-ampersand-handling-in-titles">Improved Ampersand Handling in Titles</h5>

<p>An ampersand in a <a href="title.html" class="wiki-link">Title</a> field is replaced with the word &#8220;and&#8221; when generating a filename for a Note file. However, ampersands were not undergoing a similar conversion when generating internal Note ID strings (sometimes referred to as a &#8220;lowest common denominator ID&#8221;, or just a &#8220;common ID&#8221;), and this was resulting in occasional inconsistencies. This has been corrected. </p>

<h5 id="fixed-new-field-type-selection-when-adding-renaming-a-field">Fixed New Field Type Selection when Adding/Renaming a Field</h5>

<p>The special screen to <a href="rename-a-field.html" class="wiki-link">Rename a Field</a> (or add a new field) had a bug that prevented the entire list of new field types from being displayed. This has been fixed. </p>
