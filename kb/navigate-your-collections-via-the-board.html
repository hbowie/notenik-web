<p>The Navigation Board can be summoned via the File menu, or with the indicated keyboard shortcut. </p>

<p>The Nav Board will also appear automatically if the user closes the last open Collection window. </p>

<p>The Nav Board shows all easily accessible Collections in an outline, and also offers a series of buttons allowing the user to perform various actions. </p>

<p>A combo box appears at the top left of the board. Type the first few letters of the name of a Collection&#8217;s folder in order to bring it up, then hit enter/return to select it. </p>

<p>The outline appears to the left of the window. Available Collections are available within three different groups. </p>
<ul>
<li>Help - The Help Notes appear here. </li>
<li>iCloud Container - These are the Collections stored within the <a href="the-notenik-icloud-container.html" class="wiki-link">Notenik iCloud Container</a>. </li>
<li>Recent - These are recently accessed Collections that are stored outside of the iCloud Container. </li>
</ul>

<p>Click on a disclosure triangle, or double-click on the name of a group, in order to display/hide the Collections within the group. </p>

<p>Double-click on a Collection to open it, and dismiss the Nav Board. </p>

<p>Select one or more Collections in the outline, and then press one of the buttons on the right to perform the indicated action on the selected Collections. </p>

<p>Here is more info on the actions performed by each button. </p>
<ul>
<li>Open Selected &#8211; Open all of the Collections that are currently selected in the outline. </li>
<li>Delete Selected &#8211; Delete the selected Collection. </li>
<li>Reveal Selected &#8211; Reveal the selected Collection in the Finder. </li>
<li>Open Other - If the desired Collection is not available within the outline, then click on this button so that you can select your Collection from your local file system. </li>
<li>Open Parent &#8211; Allows you to perform the <a href="open-project-folder.html" class="wiki-link">Open Project Folder</a> action from the Nav Board. </li>
