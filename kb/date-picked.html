<p>The phrase <code>Date Picked</code> can be used as both a label and a type. </p>

<p>A Collection should never have more than one field of this type. </p>

<p>This field is left blank until a user &#8216;picks&#8217; a particular note, at which point Notenik assigns the current date and time to the field. </p>

<p>This field is system-maintained, and is not directly editable by the user. </p>

<p>The field is generally displayed below all user-editable fields, and may be separated from these other fields by a divider. </p>

<p>The <em>Note</em> menu contains a <em>Pick Note</em> function, as well as an <em>Unpick Note</em> function. These will be applied to the currently selected note as viewed on the <em>Display</em> tab. These changes are made outside of the normal editing process, and so the note in question should not be in <em>Edit</em> mode when these menu selections are made. </p>

<p>Also see the <code>randompick</code> parm within the <a href="custom-url-scheme.html" class="wiki-link">Custom URL Scheme</a> for a way to select a random Note, and then set the <em>Date Picked</em> for that note. </p>

<p>The <em>Collection</em> menu also contains a function to <em>Clear All Picks</em>, which will reset all picked notes to an unpicked status (with blank dates picked). </p>

<p>When you <a href="change-the-sort-sequence.html" class="wiki-link">Change the Sort Sequence for your Collection</a>, you will have an option to sort your Collection by <em>Date Picked</em>. </p>

<p>Note that if you search for the word <code>pick</code> beneath the <em>Help</em> menu, you will see all of the available menu options that I have just described. This can be a handy shortcut, if you have trouble recalling exactly where these are all located within the menu structure. </p>

<p>This field might be useful in a couple of different ways. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Simply checking for the presence of a value can be used to distinguish <em>picked</em> notes from <em>unpicked</em> notes. </p></li>
<li><p>Sorting by this value could be useful in some circumstances, such as when generating an RSS file showing the latest <em>picks</em> first. </p></li>
</ul>
