<p>7.3.9 <a href="collection-navigation-commands.html" class="nav-link">Collection Navigation Commands</a>&#160;&#8593;</p><h5 id="generateacollectionsearchpage">7.3.9.6 Generate a Collection Search Page</h5>
<p>As an extension to the original Markdown spec from John Gruber, a Collection Search Page may be generated by placing the literal <code>{:search}</code> on a line by itself, as in the following example: </p>

<pre><code>{:search}
</code></pre>

<p>This command will generate HTML with embedded JavaScript providing a way to search the contents of the Collection for pages containing the indicated search term. </p>

<p>This command incorporates techniques found on the <a href="https://gomakethings.com/how-to-create-a-vanilla-js-search-page-for-a-static-website/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Make Things</a> site. My sincere thanks to Chris Ferdinandi for his very useful and extremely usable site. </p>

<p>The command takes one operand, which would be the web URL for the site to be searched. This operand is supplied to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DuckDuckGo</a> as the site to be searched, as a fallback search mechanism, in case the generated JavaScript fails for some reason. </p>

<p>The following would be an example of the command with the supplied operand. </p>

<pre><code>{:search: https://learnedabouthumans.org}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this command is not particularly useful when viewing a Collection within Notenik, since Notenik already has its own <a href="search.html" class="wiki-link">Search</a> capability built in. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the command becomes more useful when using Notenik to turn a Collection into a website, as with the <a href="export-as-web-book.html" class="wiki-link">Export as Web Book</a> feature, since the resulting page can be used as the primary means of searching the resulting site. </p>

<p>Note that, when using <a href="merge-templates.html" class="wiki-link">Merge Templates</a> and converting <a href="markdown-to-html-o.html" class="wiki-link">Markdown to HTML</a>, you will likely also need to use the <a href="variable-modifiers.html" class="wiki-link">Variable Modifier</a> identified as the <a href="wiki-style-links-w.html" class="wiki-link">Wiki-Style Links Mod</a>, typically with a value of &#8216;<code>w1</code>&#8217;, in order to make sure that this command resolves effectively, since it generates wiki-style links in Markdown before the conversion to HTML takes place. </p>

<p>See the <a href="search-the-knowledge-base.html" class="wiki-link">Search the Knowledge Base</a> page within this Collection for an example of the usage of this command. </p>
