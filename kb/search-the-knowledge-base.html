        content: "You will be presented with the Settings for your Collection immediately after creating it But you can always access these Settings later by selecting `Settings ` beneath the `Collection` menu Note that these are different from the application settings found beneath the `Notenik` menu The Application Settings apply globally to all of your Collections The left side of the Collection Settings allows you to tweak the Collection Title the file extension used for Notes and a few other settings See the Collection Title page for details on that field Each Note file is an ordinary text file and can be opened using any text editor in addition to being editable within Notenik Depending on what application you might wish to be the default text editor for your notes you may wish to pick some special file extension to be used The file extension of ` md` is often used for Markdown documents If you don t care about this or this doesn t make any sense to you then feel free to just ignore this whole paragraph and leave the Preferred File Extension set to the normal default of `txt` Note that if you later decide to change the `Preferred File Extension` for a Collection Notenik will automatically rename all of the existing files within that Collection to reflect your new choice Beginning with Version 10 6 0 you may explicitly set the `Preferred File Format` to be used This will change the way each Note is internally formatted on disk The default is to use a special Notenik Note File Format If you wish to make your Notes compatible with other software however you may wish to make a different choice Both YAML and MultiMarkdown allow for metadata fields other than Title and Body but in a slightly different format than that preferred by Notenik See Existing Text Files for more info on alternate formats Also beginning with Version 10 6 0 you may explicitly set the option to save Tags with Hash signs This will change the way each Note is internally formatted on disk Again this may increase interoperability of your Notes when using other software Note that if you change the `Preferred File Format` or the hash tags option then Notenik will reformat all of the Notes in your Collection to use the new format Data loss is possible when doing this so you may wish to backup your Notes before making such a change Enter a shortcut for a Collection as one way to reference it later via a Collection Identifier Select an option to tailor your Note Title Display The default is a normal font size with a bold style applied See the separate page below for details The following controls are available and can be used to modify augment the appearance of Notes on the Display tab + Include Explicit Body field label for Note This is checked by default but you can uncheck it if you d prefer to see your Notes displayed without a leading Body label + Display Mode This allows the user to select from four options normal Streamlined Reading Presentation Mode or Quotations Mode with normal being the default + Rerun Mirror Indexing with every Update See the Mirror your Notes page for more info + Enable Mathjax V3 Check this box to load the Mathjax javascript package so that math symbols and equations will display properly This is off by default See the Mathjax Support page for more info + Enable Local Image References This is off by default because in order to enable local image file references the HTML formatted for the Display tab must first be written to disk instead of being loaded from memory If you have stored images somewhere in your Collection folder and you want them to appear on the Display tab then check this box + Create Notes for Missing Wiki Link Targets This option is off by default If you turn it on for a Collection then whenever Notenik encounters a Note containing a wiki style link to a second Note and that Note does not yet exist Notenik will create a Note with the targeted title and with text in the body of the new Note pointing back to the referencing Note + Open External Links in new Tabs Windows If this option is checked then Markdown links other than Wiki Links will have the code `target= blank rel= noopener ` included in their anchor elements which should result in the target of the link being opened in a new browser window or tab depending on the user s browser settings + Attempt to Sync Display and Edit Scrolling If this is off which is the default then Notenik will return the user to the last scroll position in their editing of the Body field and to their last position on the Display tab when the user is switching back and forth between the Edit and Dispay tabs while working on the same Note When this setting if off though scrolling to a new position on the Display tab will not result in a change in the scroll position on the Edit tab nor will the reverse occur When this setting is on then scrolling on one tab will result in Notenik attempting to scroll to an equivalent position on the other tab Such attempts will tend to be imperfect though since the Display tab scroller is for the entire Note all fields and the Edit scroller is only for the Body field This sort of synchronized scrolling may work reasonably well in some cases but not in others so adjust this setting accordingly + Minimum Body Edit Height in Lines This numeric value can be adjusted using the provided slider just below It defaults to 5 lines but can be set as high as 60 lines This value can also be adjusted up or down in increments of 5 lines by using the appropriate menu items beneath the View menu Adjusting this value upwards can be useful if you have a Collection with lots of metadata fields and you are finding that the Edit tab is sometimes devoting too little space to the actual body of the Note List of Fields The right side of the window allows you to choose the fields you would like to include in the Collection Feel free to check additional ones if they seem useful to you If you would like to further customize the list of fields for a Collection read about the Collection Template file consulting the section on Field Labels and Types as necessary Other Fields Allowed Note that the last checkbox on the right side is a bit different from the others It asks if `Other Fields Allowed This is unchecked by default which means that Notenik will only recognize a field in a Note if it has been defined in advance for the Collection either by checking the field label here on the Collection Settings window or by adding it to the template file directly via an external text editor If you check this box then anything in any of your Notes that looks like a separate field will be treated as such whether or not it starts with one of your predefined field labels for the Collection In general it is better to not allow other random fields to be recognized as such to prevent cases of misinterpretation of your Notes On the other hand there may be cases where the additional flexibility is worth the risk"

schemes `https` `mailto` etc as might usefully be referenced including its own Custom URL Scheme and will attempt to handle each according to its type When editing a link field will appear as an auxiliary text field To enter a long link value click on the Edit button to the right For display purposes links will generally be styled as a link and will be clickable The first link field encountered within a Note will be considered the Note s primary link field and will be acted upon by any special buttons commands designed to open or otherwise act on that Note s link These actions will typically open the link within the user s preferred Web browser such as Safari or Chrome You can easily Launch a link from within the Notenik Mac App by clicking on the Launch Link button in the Toolbar or by selecting Launch Link under the Note menu or by using the keyboard shortcut CMD L or by double clicking on the Note s line in the List view or the Tags view You may also Ctrl Click or right click etc on a row in the List tab or the Tags tab then select `Launch Link` from the contextual menu that appears in order to launch a link If you first select multiple rows then Ctrl Click on any one of those rows and select `Launch Link` then the links for all of the selected Notes will be launched You may select multiple rows by Cmd Clicking on each row to be selected or by first clicking on a starting row and then using shift click on the last row in a range to be selected Multiple Links may also be launched by using the `Launch Link` command beneath the `Note` menu Adding a Link to a Note doesn t necessarily reduce the Note to a simple Bookmark but this is certainly one way to use a Collection of Notes Note that if you use a Link to point to a local folder containing another Notenik Collection then Launching that Link will result in opening the linked Collection within Notenik so long as you have given Notenik permission to access that folder You may use the Set Local Link command under the Note menu to choose a file or folder to be linked the resulting path string will then replace any value previously stored in the Link field for the current Note Also see the File Links page You may use the Wikipedia Link command under the Note menu to populate the first or only Link field for a Note with the Note s title converted to a link to that subject on Wikipedia This command may be invoked while in Edit mode or in Display mode This conversion will not always result in a link to a valid Wikipedia page so you should test the Link for accuracy and relevance after using this command You may use the `Clean Link` command beneath the `Note` menu to remove any tracking parameters associated with a Link that you wish to save Thanks to Robb Knight and his TrackerZapper https github com rknightuk TrackerZapper utility for the idea and the code As an example the link `http www example com utm source=exampleblog utm medium=referral utm campaign=summer sale` would be reduced to `http www example com ` After selecting this menu item the user will be presented with a window offering a few options The default source will be the system clipboard so that a link you copied from somewhere else will be the default starting point for the clean operation Alternatively you can use the current `Link` field value from the currently selected Note as your starting point Then you can choose what you wish done with the clean link You may cancel to do nothing with it or save it to the system clipboard as if you had copied it or place it into the `Link` field of the currently selected Note This command may be invoked while in Edit mode or in Display mode Note that you can drag a bookmark from a Web browser such as Safari or Chrome and drop it into an open Collection s List view in order to add that bookmark to the Collection as a new Note A bookmark can typically be dragged either from the browser s URL field at the top of the screen or from a link within a page The result of such a drag and drop operation will be a new Note with its Title and Link fields populated If you add a Link value without any URL scheme then the implicit scheme of https will be assumed In other words you need only enter Notenik app in the link field but https Notenik app is what will be passed to your Web browser when requesting Notenik to open the Link Remember that a link stored in its own field is a somewhat different animal from a link coded using Markdown syntax within a Note s body In order to increase interoperability with other apps such as iA Writer any surrounding less than greater than signs will be stripped off when a Link value is read from disk and such signs will be added when saving to disk if the link is using some sort of unusual protocol unlikely to be recognized as a link by other apps Display of Links Starting with Version 13 4 0 the display of links will be modified somewhat First link fields are new styled with the `ext link` class which is an existing class defined on the HTML Class Values page This will generally make the styling of links here consistent with the appearance of links within the Body of the note Second the contents of the display string shown for a link field can now be modified using a special set of values to be placed in the the Collection Template File See the following for an example ``` Ref Link <link x|s|s|x|x > ``` Notice there are five separate single character values separated by pipe characters Each position can have one of the following values + a Display this part of the link as is without any modification + x Exclude this component of the link + s Simplify the representation of this component of the link see explanation below And the five positions represent the following five components of a URL https www tutorialrepublic com html tutorial html url php + Scheme as in `http ` or `https ` + Host as in `en wikipedia org` + Path as in ` wiki Main Page` + Query as in ` what the heck` + Fragment as in ` section 3` A couple of things to note + Such a formatting string will only be applied to links that appear to be valid URLs with a scheme of `http` or `https` Anything else will simply be displayed as is + If you fail to supply any formatting string then the default will be to display all links as is And now to explain what we mean by simplifying the presentation of a component First this only applies to the Host and the Path There are no simplification algorithms for the other three parts so they will be displayed as is unless they are excluded For the Host the following rules will be applied + Any leading characters followed by a period such as `www` will be dropped along with the following period + If the last part of the host the Top Level Domain is ` com` or ` org` then it will be dropped Other TLDs will be included in the display + The first character of the second level domain will be capitalized For the Path the following rules will be applied + If the path ends with a file extension such as ` html` or ` php` then that will be dropped + Any elements of the path other than the last will be dropped + Spaces will replace any dashes or underscores And then if the host and or the path were simplified then the two will be separated by a colon and a space rather than a slash So for example given the formatting string above this URL ``` https en wikipedia org wiki Comparison of note taking software ``` would be displayed like this ``` Wikipedia Comparison of note taking software ``` Depending on what you are using a Collection for and what sort of links you are recording this sort of formatting may or may not be useful to you In some cases though it can make the text of the link much easier to read for humans trying to parse all the pieces"

version number or priority that can be used to put the Notes of a Collection into some meaningful order A Seq field may contain letters digits and one or more periods aka decimal points or dots or hyphens or a dollar sign $ You may wish to assign a unique Seq value to each Note in a Collection but Notenik does not require this in other words it does allow duplicate Seq values to be assigned to different Notes When editing the seq field will appear as a single line of editable text When displayed the seq field will be displayed as entered When used as a sort field seq values will be padded to cause them to sort into a natural order rather than a strict character by character alphanumeric order In other words a value of `2` will sort before a value of `10` a value of `b` will sort before `aa` etc Each segment of this field when separated by a dot or a dash will be padded separately A seq field can also be used to store a time of day In this case colons and spaces will be recognized as

selected Note has a seq value then the new Note s seq will be initialized by incrementing the selected Note s seq value In other words if you have your list sorted by Seq then a new Note will be inserted immediately following the selected Note If you want to insert a new note with a Seq Value already assigned to another Note then first select the other Note then use the `Increment` command under the `Note` menu to increment the Seq field of the existing note as well as following notes that might otherwise cause duplicate Seq values If your Notes have a two part Seq field i e 1 00 then use the `Increment Major Seq` command beneath the `Note` menu to force the numbers to the left of the decimal point to be incremented rather than incrementing the numbers on the right You can perform some basic resequencing by dragging and dropping a Note from one position to another on the List tab Note that you must move the Drop indicator to a line above and or below existing Notes in order to indicate a desired new position for an existing Note in other words not on top of an existing Note Only the Note being dragged and dropped will have its Seq value changed Starting with Version 7 9 0 you can also modify the Seq values for an entire range of Notes The first step is to select the range to be renumbered on the List tab Then use Ctrl Click or right click to obtain the contextual menu then select `Modify Seq ` from the menu You will be presented with a new window showing the range you have selected and then allowing you to enter a new Seq value for the first Note in the range Once you ve entered that new value and hit the `OK` button the entire range will be renumbered This command doesn t make use of or modify the Level values if present but the structure of the range as represented by the levels of numbering for each Note will be preserved The Seq value for following Notes will not be modified so if you re moving a block of Notes into an existing sequence then you may wish to increment the Seq value for the new following Notes before initiating the `Modify Seq` operation Starting with Version 8 7 0 you may edit the Collection Template file and add codes to control the formatting of Seq values in secondary displays Primary displays of Seq values occur on the display of the Note in question Primary displays always carry the full unformatted Seq value Secondary displays of Seq values may arise when showing the contents of a higher level Note These are the sorts of displays that will be affected by formatting codes specified in the Collection template file Here is an example of such formatting codes ``` Seq <seq x|n |x|x > ``` In this example + The first `Seq` is the field label + The next `seq` is the field type + The `<` and `>` enclose

into a new folder using YAML metadata rather than the Notenik format The new folder will be formatted so that it can be opened by Notenik as a Collection which means that it will have some extra files ` INFO nnk` ` README txt` and `template md` Feel free to delete these if they are not needed Import Export in Tab Delimited Format Each Note will be represented as one row line and each field will be represented in a separate column Tabs are used to separate columns This format is suitable for import into MS Excel for example Import Export in CSV Format Each Note will be represented as one row line and each field will be represented in a separate column Commas are used to separate columns This format is suitable for import into MS Excel for example You can apply Import Settings to the import operation Import from OmniFocus You can use either the plain text or csv exports from OmniFocus See the next section Import from OmniFocus for further info specific to this topic Import Text File You can select a single text file to be imported This can be in simple Markdown format or in any format valid for Existing Text Files The same effect can be achieved from the Finder by dragging the text file onto the List tab of the target Collection window Import Folder of Text Files When importing a folder of text files Notenik will suspend its usual rule about respecting existing Collection field definitions and will instead add all fields found in the input to the existing Collection even if they are not already defined for the Collection Import in XML format This option allows former users of iWisdom to import the most important fields in their collections into Notenik Selecting a folder will cause Notenik to try to import all files with the xml extension within that folder and its subfolders Export in JSON Format Each Note will be represented as one JSON object Export in OPML Format Each Note will be represented as an outline object See how to Using Notenik as an Outliner for more info on outlining Import OPML using Seq Level Each outline object will be added as a separate Note and the Seq and Level fields will be used to indicate the sequence and depth of the items Import OPML using Headings The entire outline defined in the OPML file will be loaded into the body of one new Note using the Generate Outline Based on Headings Markdown extension Import OPML using Lists The entire outline defined in the OPML fild will be loaded into the body of one new Note using the Generate Outline Based on Unordered List Items Markdown extension Import vCards This can be used to import a standard vCard file with the extension of ` vcf` in order to create Notes representing contact cards This is probably easier if you start with the Contacts starter pack when creating a new Collection although it is not necessary See the Import vCards section for further information Export in Concatenated HTML or Markdown A single file will be produced with all Notes in the Collection appearing one after another in the selected format HTML or Markdown Notes will appear in whatever Sort Sequence you have currently selected for the Collection If you ve selected the Streamlined Reading option in the Collection Settings then the focus of the content will be on the Seq Title and Body fields The overall intent is to combine all of the Notes in your Collection into a single document If you Generate a Collection Table of Contents in one of the Collection s Notes then the generated Table of Contents will appear in the output even for the Concatenated Markdown option Export to HTML Outline As with Concatenated HTML a single file will be produced with all Notes in the Collection appearing one after another In order to use this export option effectively the Collection should have a Seq field and a Level field and should be sorted by the Seq field See Using Notenik as an Outliner for additional info Each Note s Title will appear with a disclosure triangle to the left and clicking on the triangle will reveal the body of that Note plus any additional Notes that are effectively children of the current Note in the outline Export as a Web Book See the following section Export as Web Book for further info on this option When exporting the Notes in a Collection you will be presented with a few options for the export Output Format Described above File extension Pick from the list or type in a custom extension Use Tags Export Settings Select Yes if you wish the current Tags Export Settings to be applied You may filter the notes to be exported for any of the output formats other than the Notenik format by adjusting the entries in the Tags Export settings You may specify one or more Tags to be selected so that only notes containing those Tags will be exported You may also suppress one or more Tags meaning that exported notes will have those Tags removed from the resulting output For example if you have a collection of blog entries stored as a Collection of Notes and you have multiple blogs to which they are published you can specify Tags for the relevant blogs for each note and then select only those Notes when publishing a particular blog and suppress the Tags for the other blogs If you leave the Tags to Select field blank then all Notes will be exported Note that the Tags Export Settings are global across all Collections Split Tags Select Yes if you wish one row to be written for each Tag on each Note This will result in a special export in which each Note may be written multiple times once for each Tag in the Note s Tags field Notes without any Tags will be written only once with a blank Tag field In other cases the Tag field will contain a single Tag even if the Tags field contains multiple Tags Add Web Extensions Select Yes to add a number of fields that can be useful for generating Web pages Quick Export and Open An alternative export method is available at the bottom of the File menu to perform a `Quick Export and Open` This command will export the current Collection to a CSV comma separated values file located within a sub folder named `quick export` and named `export csv` If the export was successful then Notenik will ask the operating system to open the CSV file using the default app for handling csv files such as the Numbers app opml https en wikipedia org wiki OPML"

writing If you d like to see more context feel free to review additional code for the site on GitHub https github com hbowie notenik web As noted earlier a script file is a text file formatted into five columns using either tabs or commas as delimiters to separate the columns In order to make this example easier to read I ve formatted the columns as a table and I ve added the first column containing a row number so that I can refer back to specific rows in the notes that appear below the table This extra column is as they say only for illustrative purposes and should not appear in an actual script file You ll see that this script consists of multiple steps The general sequence for each step is as follows 1 Open the input data source 2 Filter the data as needed if you only want to use a subset of the data for this step 3 Sort the data into the desired sequence 4 Use one or more Merge Templates to generate your desired output If you have multiple templates needing the same data in the same sort sequence then you can specify one after the other without needing to repeat the `input` `filter` and `sort` bits for each template One technique you ll see below is that earlier steps can sometimes generate output that is used in later steps Later steps often make use of the output from earlier steps by way of the Merge Template include command | | module | action | modifier |

be pertinent to creating any sort of Notenik Collection Knowledge of these basics will be assumed in later articles Step 1 Create a New Collection Within Notenik Notes are always stored within Collections and you may have as many different Collections as you desire Each Collection is stored on disk as its own folder and each Note within a Collection is stored as a file within that folder You get to decide where to store your Collection s and you can always navigate to them within the Finder Hint Store a Collection in your Dropbox folder or in iCloud Drive if you d like to sync it to the cloud and to other devices To create a new Collection select one of the New commands from the `File` menu If you re unsure how to proceed review the earlier article Creating and Tailoring a Collection of Notes or simply select `New in iCloud ` Step 2 Indicate Your Collection Settings Make sure that at a minimum your Collection has the Title Tags Link and Body fields Step 3 Add Some Notes Your new Collection will be initially populated with a Note titled Notenik Feel free to delete this later but first you must add one or more of your own Notes to the Collection so that it is not empty Click on the Plus Sign + in the Toolbar to add a Note Enter a brief Title indicating the subject of the Note Each Note in a Collection must have a unique Title Enter whatever you like in the Body of your Note You may use the Markdown syntax to format the body of your Note If you ve elected to use the Link field and if you have some sort of URL you d like to associate with this Note then enter that Web address in the Link field Tags can be used to organize the Notes within a Collection You may enter from zero to many Tags for each Note and may enter one or more levels for each Tag Separate different Tags with a comma or a semicolon and separate different levels with a period When you re done with your data entry hit the Display tab above the fields next to the Edit tab or the OK button in the Toolbar Your Note will then be saved and a formatted display of your Note will replace the Edit screen Add other Notes in the same way As you add Notes they will appear on the List tab on the left side of your window sorted by Title Step 4 Open Links Later when referencing your Notes you may open a Link in your Web browser Safari for example by hitting the Launch Link button in the Toolbar Note that you can also click on the Link field within the Display tab but clicking here will open the linked webpage within the Notenik Display tab rather than in your Web browser When you re done viewing the linked webpage within Notenik you can click on the Refresh button in the Toolbar to reload your Note within the Display tab Step 5 View the Tags Outline If you have elected to enter Tags for your Notes then you may click on the Tags tab next to the List tab to see your Notes arranged by their Tags Notes appear on this tab within an outline view You can open and close tags and sub tags if present to reveal or hide various groups of notes Step 6 Adjust the Display Font If you d like to see your Notes displayed differently on the Display tab then hit the Display Fonts button on the Toolbar You can use the resulting screen to select a different font family and can also adjust the font size If you re familiar with CSS then you can edit the resulting CSS code directly if you d like When you re done hit OK to see your changes take effect on the Display tab You may need to click on one or two Notes before the changes take effect Step 7 Adjust the Edit Font Size Use the bottom three commands under the View menu to adjust the size of the font used on the Edit screen if you d like it to be larger or smaller Note that font changes on the Display tab and on the Edit tab will affect the way all Collections are displayed within Notenik Font settings cannot be made on a collection by collection basis Step 8 Make Your Collection Essential If you d like this Collection to be opened automatically the next time you launch Notenik then choose the `Make This Collection Essential` command under the `File` menu If you ve specified an Essential Collection then it will be opened automatically each time you open Notenik Step 9 Share Your Notes Click on the Share button on the Toolbar to share a Note in an email a text message or via any of the other standard sharing tools available on a Mac Notes shared in this fashion will just be formatted as plain text However there s also another sharing option available under the Note menu When you select Share here you will see another screen that will present you with a number of sharing options Share the body of the Note only or share all of the fields Share in the Notenik format in Markdown or in HTML as either a fragment or a complete document Send the resulting output to the Clipboard so that you can then paste it somewhere else or to a file whose name and location you will then get to specify After you ve chosen the appropriate options hit the OK button to complete the sharing Summary Well that s it You ve seen how you can use Notenik to create a basic collection of Notes to keep track of information on any topic that might interest you Hopefully you can find some uses for this most basic Notenik function In later articles we will move on to more sophisticated uses appstore https apps apple com us app notenik

        content: "All modern web browsers Safari Chrome Firefox etc have their own capabilities for storing frequently used web links aka URLs as a bunch of bookmarks sometimes referred to as favorites However if you have a tendency to use different browsers for different purposes or as the mood strikes you then you might find it convenient to have your favorite web bookmarks stored independently in a way that can be accessed equally well from any browser This is where Notenik comes in Step 1 Create a New Collection Name the folder Favorites or Bookmarks or something similar If you have Apache enabled apache then you might wish to place it somewhere in your Sites folder If you have no idea what this means then don t worry about it Another option would be to place the new Collection in your Dropbox folder or iCloud Drive if you d like it to be synced to the cloud and or to other devices Or just put it somewhere in your Documents folder It s up to you Step 2 Configure with Default Fields Title Tags Link and Body should be fine for our purposes in this article Step 3 Add Your Favorite Websites For each site enter the Link field and the Title field For a title enter whatever is most meaningful to you it doesn t have to exactly match any sort of official title on the site itself If you wish to add some comments about a site in the body of its note then that s ok too You can also drag a website into the List tab of Notenik from the address field of your Web browser Step 4 Use Tags to Categorize the Sites Here there s something specific you need to enter in order to enable a later step Enter your tag in the format Favorites xxx where xxx is the category you wish to assign to the note The first part of the tag must be favorites although the case upper or lower is not significant If you have a lot of bookmarks you wish to track in Notenik then they don t all need to have the Favorites tag In fact a maximum of about 60 is recommended And all of your tags including the ones tagged as a favorite can have multiple tags With or without the favorites tag note that you can use the Tags tab to view your growing list of bookmarks in outline form with the tags used to organize the outline When a note has multiple tags it will appear multiple times so that it can show up under each different tag Step 5 Launch Links from within Notenik Once you have your bookmarks entered into Notenik you can always open that collection select the bookmark you are interested in and then launch the link either via the Toolbar command or via the command beneath the Note menu or by using the CMD L keyboard shortcut Launching the Link via any of these methods will result in the page opening in your default web browser Safari Chrome etc But wait there s more Step 6 Save your Favorites to HTML Beneath the `File` menu there is an option to save your `Favorites to HTML` Once you select this command you ll be prompted to specify a file name and location Once you ve completed this Notenik will generate a web page for you containing all of the bookmarks you have tagged as Favorites grouped neatly into the categories you have specified After saving this web page for you Notenik will ask that it be opened by your default web browser Once this happens if you look at the URL for the page you ll see the location you specified expressed as a local file URL starting with the file protocol Step 7 Adjust Settings The defaults are to arrange your favorite links into 4 columns with each column a maximum of 32 lines long and each column taking up a screen width of 250 pixels I ve found that these defaults work well for me but if you d like to adjust them you can use the Favorites tab within Notenik s application Settings to bump them up or down to suit your tastes and screen real estate The other settings you might want to adjust are your Display Fonts You can get to these by clicking on the appropriately named button on your toolbar or by selecting Display Appearance beneath the Format menu You can then change the Display font and the display size These settings will primarily affect the appearance of your Notes on the Display tab for all of your collections these settings are not collection specific but these same values will also be used for the webpage generated when you select Favorites to HTML beneath the File menu After making changes to any of these settings you will need to repeat Step 6 overwriting the file you created previously in order to see the effects of your changes Step 8 Set As Your Browser Home Page Once you have the generated HTML looking the way you would like you will want to select the generated page s URL from your browser and copy it Now go into the Settings for each web browser that you use and paste this local file address into the field identifying your homepage or your home button You might also want to specify that new browser windows and or tabs will open to your homepage That s it Now whenever you open your web browser you ll see a nice clean page showing all of your favorite websites without any advertising or tracking or animation or javascript or cookies or download delays Just click on any of the titles to be taken to the corresponding website And sites will be named and categorized and located in a way that makes sense to you making it easy for you to find the site you are looking for and open it When you want to add remove or change the contents of this page then all you have to do is re open your Notenik collection of favorites make the desired changes there then repeat step 6 making sure to overwrite the file you created before by specifying the same location and file name From that point on the new page will appear in all of the browsers you have set to this homepage understanding that you may sometimes have to ask the browser to reload the page to replace any cached copies it might be holding on to apache https tech cookbook com 2020 11 14 setting up

        content: "My little Mac App Notenik store falls into the general category of note taking software And it certainly lacks many of the features to be found in a sophisticated outlining app such as OmniOutliner oo And creating any kind of outliner ol was never any part of my original intent when starting out to develop Notenik But then some stuff happened along the way Which in retrospect should not have been too surprising You see the whole concept of Notenik has always been based on three premises 1 A Note is a chunk of text written using Markdown md identified by a title ready to be transformed into HTML 2 Each Note can also have a custom set of fields associated with it additional descriptive data that can be used for sorting filtering categorization display and whatever else you might want to do with it 3 Notes are grouped into Collections and the Notes within a Collection can be arranged and connected in various meaningful ways so that a Collection can become a thing unto itself a website a book and be more than just a repository for Notes Pretty straightforward wouldn t you say But given this starting point I guess it was only a matter of time before outlining crept into Notenik Especially if as I do you tend to build an outline not just with heading rows but with some substantial content beneath each heading So with the idea of outlining in mind let s take a second look at the three premises listed above 1 Each Note in the Collection becomes a node in the outline The title of each Note becomes a line row with any associated text being written in Markdown and tucked into the body of the Note 2 We need only add two special fields to transform a Collection of Notes into an outline A sequence field to allow the Notes to be placed into the desired order A level field indicating each Note s relationship to surrounding Notes as a parent and or a child 3 A Collection of Notes then becomes an outline A field type of `Level` was added to Notenik as part of Version 6 3 0 released on June 10 2021 and this was the initial change that made outlining possible But lots of little things have been added since then to make outlining easier so this seems like a good time to call out all of those goodies in one place for others who may be interested but also for my own future reference Most of these features are available via various menu options within Notenik so I ll provide the menu path wherever appropriate and the keyboard shortcut when one is available Unless specifically described otherwise these commands will affect the Note appearing on the currently selected row of the List tab A Sample Outline Once you ve downloaded and installed a copy of Notenik onto your Mac you can access the complete documentation by using `Help > Notenik Knowledge Base` or by simply clicking on this link help You ll see that the Notenik Knowledge Base is organized using an outline structure so you ll be able to see how some of the features I describe below appear within the app The Knowledge Base will be opened in a read only mode though so you ll have to create your own Collection in order to experiment with the updating features described below Creating a Collection for Outlining If you re completely new to Notenik then you might want to review the Notenik Intro intro Once you ve got the hang of the basics you can create a new Collection with both Seq and Level fields or just use the `Outline` starting point to create your new Collection If different levels in your structure will have special meanings for you then you can edit your Collection Template file to add labels reflective of those meanings Then sort your Collection by Seq + Title and start adding items to your outline Flexible Numbering with the Seq Field The Seq field itself offers a lot of flexibility You can use numbers or letters and you can separate different levels with either dots or dashes Each level is padded appropriately for sorting so everything should appear in the sequence you would expect Numbers and dots are generally preferred over letters and dashes though You don t have to tell Notenik what sort of numbering you want just assign one or more Seq values and Notenik will follow your lead Note that the number of levels or segments within your Seq values should generally parallel the values of the level field Tailoring the Level Field Values When you first specify a Level field for a Collection the allowable range of values will default to 0 through 9 and will be displayed as simple integers However you can edit the Collection Template file Opt Cmd T and make two sorts of helpful changes for Level values First you can constrain the available levels to what might be a more reasonable range say 1 6 for example second you can specify a descriptive label to accompany each integer which might help as a reminder of what each level in your hierarchy would typically represent Here s an example of an edited version of the relevant line in the Collection Template file Level <level 1 Book Title 2 Section 3 Chapter > Note that the terms lower and higher can be confusing when talking about an outline level since a higher integer value generally implies a lower level in the hierarchy I ll generally use these terms in their strictly numerical sense and will also occasionally use the term deeper to indicate that we re using a higher digit to go deeper into the outline structure Import from OPML If you already have an outline that you ve started someplace else then you can probably export it into OPML and then use `File > Import > OPML` to get that data into Notenik List Title Indentation As you build your outline you ll notice that the titles on the List tab reflect the structure of your outline with each deeper level appearing indented by an extra couple of spaces This spacing gives you a visual indication of the relative levels within your outline Increment Seq Notenik doesn t insist that every Note have a unique Seq value but if you re building an outline then you probably want things in a particular sequence and so each Note will need a unique Seq value in order to preserve your intended order When you need to insert a new Note into an existing sequence then you ll want to select the Note following the intended insertion point and use `Note > Increment` Cmd I to increment the Seq value for that Note as well as all following consecutively numbered Notes Then select the preceding Note and add the new Note using any of the methods below Increment Major Seq If you want to make room for a new Note node at the top level you can use `Note > Increment Major Seq` Opt Cmd I to increment the Seq value of the selected Note at the top level of numbering Indent Outdent You can use `Note > Indent` Opt Cmd to further indent the selected Note bumping the level up by 1 and renumbering the Seq to add a segment while still keeping consecutive numbering following the prior Note Similarly you can use `Note > Outdent` Opt Cmd to decrease the level by 1 and to renumber the Seq to remove a segment while still preserving consecutive numbering following the prior Note If you wish to change the levels and numbering for a whole range of Notes then select the range first before invoking the `Indent` or `Outdent` commands New Notes in Sequence If you select a Note then use `Note > New Note` Cmd N the Edit tab for the new Note will be pre populated with the same level and the next Seq value This makes it easy to continue adding additional Notes nodes at the same level and in a consecutive sequence New Child If you select a Note then alt click or right click on it you ll see a context menu offering you several options and one of them will be `New Child` This will pre populate the Edit tab for the new Note with a level one higher than the previous one and with the previous Seq value being set to 1 at the next higher level So if you ve added a higher level heading and then want to start adding children beneath it just use this `New Child` trick once then add new Notes as usual to continue adding children at the deeper level New Note with Options If you d like even more options for adding a new Note in sequence choose `Note > New Note w Options` Opt Cmd N You ll then be presented with a small window offering some useful outlining options The initial Level value will be set to match the preceding Note but you can choose a new Level from a drop down list or use the `+ ` buttons to increase decrease the level As you modify the level the Seq value shown below will be modified appropriately Click `OK` to pre populate the Edit tab for your new Note with the chosen values Drag and Drop and Set Seq If you have a single Note you d like to reposition within your outline you can select it on the List tab then drag and drop it to a new location before and or after other Notes The Note s Seq value will then be updated to follow the Note above If such an action would cause a duplicate then you would need to use the `Increment Seq` action described above on the following Note before performing the drag and drop You can also drag other eligible items from outside of the Collection such as a URL from Safari and drop them between existing Notes to indicate the Seq value to be assigned to the new Note Modify Seq Values for a Range of Notes You can also modify the Seq values for an entire range of Notes The first step is to select the range to be renumbered on the List tab Then use Ctrl Clck or right click to obtain the contextual menu then select `Modify Seq ` from the menu You will be presented with a new window showing the range you have selected and then allowing you to enter a new Seq value for the first Note in the range Once you ve entered that new value and hit the `OK` button the entire range will be renumbered This command doesn t make use of the Level values if present but the structure of the range as represented by the levels of numbering for each Note will be preserved The Seq value for following Notes will not be modified so if you re moving a block of Notes into an existing sequence then you may wish to increment the Seq value for the new following Notes before initiating the `Modify Seq` operation Renumber Seq Based on Level You ll find a couple of level related functions beneath the `Collection` menu The first is accessed by choosing `Collection > Level > Renumber Seq based on Level` When you invoke this function your entire Collection will be renumbered consecutively with the Seq levels following the Level values specified for each Note This can be useful if your Notes are already in your desired sequence with their appropriate Level values but you wish to close up gaps or otherwise rationalize the Seq values assigned Note that if your very first Note has a blank Seq value equivalent to a zero and makes use of the first numerically lowest Level value then following Notes will be sequenced starting with a value of `1` not `0 1` even if later Notes use the next higher Level value Add Tags based on Seq and Level This is the other level related function you ll find beneath the `Collection` menu You can access this function by choosing `Collection > Level > Add Tags based on Seq and Level` When you invoke this function Notenik will generate a special tag starting with `levels outline` You ll find this on the Tags tab You can then click on disclosure triangles to inspect the various levels of your outline This view just gives you another way to navigate your outline Opt for Streamlined Reading If you choose `Collection > Settings` Cmd then you ll see a few helpful options for formatting the Display tab for your Collection Changing these settings is purely optional but you might find some or all of them beneficial when viewing and navigating a Collection being used as an outline + `Include explicit Body field label on Display ` By default Notenik displays the Body field of each Note in the same way it displays most other Note fields with a field label preceding the value If you find this `Body ` label to be superfluous then you ll want to uncheck this option + `Display Note Titles as Level 1 Headings ` If you select this option then the title of each Note will be displayed in a larger bolder font than it would be otherwise + `Format Display for Streamlined Reading ` Checking this option produces a number of effects on the Display tab generally simplifying the contents of the display but also adding a link at the top of the display to facilitate navigation to the parent of the current Note and links at the bottom to allow direct navigation to any of the children of the current Note These effects can be very useful for navigating an outline structure Hide Show Toolbar and List If you d like an even cleaner look focused on reading and using the `Streamlined Reading` navigational links to get around then you can use `View > Hide Toolbar` and `View > Show Toolbar` to toggle the toolbar display at the top of the Collection window You can also use `View > Show Hide List` Cmd Y to toggle the display of the left hand side of the Collection window containing the `List` and `Tags` tabs Include Children Field If you decide to use the Streamlined Reading mode then there s an additional field you might want to consider for your Collection The `Include Children` field can be used to pull the children of a Note up into the display for the parent Note This is especially useful if you re preparing the Collection for publication as a Web Book You can choose among several different options for formatting the display of the children This can be useful if each of the children should really be represented as a separate node in your outline but might be better read as bullets for example on the parent Note s page Generate a Collection Table of Contents Insert a line like the following into the Body field of any Note to generate a Table of Contents with indentation following the outline structure of your Collection ``` collection toc ``` Insert a line like the following to limit the levels included in the Table of Contents ``` collection toc 2 3 ``` Export Your Outline Notenik provides lots of options for getting your outline into alternate formats The following options are most likely to be useful ways to export an outline + Export as OPML + Export as Concatenated HTML + Export as Concatenated Markdown + Export as a Web Book In Summary Whew that s a lot of functionality available for maintaining a Collection of Notes as an outline Again there are certainly more powerful dedicated outlining tools available and I encourage you to check them out Notenik s mission is to provide a free flexible open source note taking app for the Mac that stores all your notes in simple text files And a big part of Notenik s flexibility comes from its ability to not only associate a set of custom fields with each Note but to allow you to tailor the available custom fields by Collection so that each new Collection can have a different set of fields appropriate for its particular purpose And if some of those Collections turn out to be outlines then Notenik has a growing set of features that can help you out with this sort of structure help notenik help intro https notenik app intro EPUB html welcome to notenik html md https daringfireball

        content: "I ve maintained my own Digital Commonplace Book dcm for years and one of the challenges with maintaining a collection of notable quotations is the repetition of information from one Note to another the same author and even the same work along with accompanying information may be repeated numerous times It is annoying tedious time consuming and error prone to re enter that information on each Note but there is no workable alternative when dealing with only a single flat file or single Collection of Notes in our case Version 7 0 0 of Notenik however introduced Lookup fields which allow one Collection to reference Notes in other Collections and we can now use such fields to solve our repetition problem And starting with Version 9 2 0 of Notenik you have an option when created a new Collection to initialize it as a `Commonplace with Lookups` This is now the best way to start creating your own Notenik Commonplace book So if you haven t already I suggest you go ahead now and create a new Collection for yourself using the `Commonplace with Lookups` model as your starting point The rest of this article will then walk through your new Collection to explain how everything works In order to understand all the details it may help at times to make use of a text editor in order to see what s going on under the hood Three Nested Collections First we need to understand that our Commonplace book consists of three different Notenik Collections We might arrange these Collections in a variety of positions relative to each other but my model implementation has these three Collections nested within one other The `author notes` folder is at the bottom within the `author works` folder and the `author works` folder is within the main folder however you have named it There are a couple of advantages to arranging things this way + When you open the top folder you will automatically be granted access to all three Collections + There s less chance of the Collections becoming separated or disconnected from one another So now let s look at each Collection in turn starting at the bottom We ll look at the Collection Template File for each Collection since this is where the fields are defined as well as the relationships between Collections You may find it handy to use the Open Parent Realm command on the top folder of your new Commonplace book since this will give you a convenient way to open each of the three Collections in turn Author Notes Here s what the Collection Template file looks like for the `author notes` Collection ``` Author <title> Tags <tags> Author Info Author Years Author Link <link> Author Notes <body> ``` Let me comment on this a bit Every Collection needs to have a title field and a body field and it s generally good to have a tags field as well Note however that with recent versions of Notenik it s enough to have these field types without having to use these exact labels So here you can see we re taking advantage of this flexibility by labeling the first field `Author` and the latter field `Author Notes` `Author Info` `Author Years` and `Author Link` are just additional pieces of information I wanted to record for each author Your needs and interests may vary BTW you ll see that I m entering the author names with first names first in other words Raymond Chandler as opposed to Chandler Raymond I recommend you do the same and make this practice consistent One other important point is the shortcut assigned to the Collection on the Collection Settings screen It should be set to `qauthors` This is the field that will allow your other Collections to lookup information in this Collection Author Works This is the next Collection moving up from the bottom of the folder structure Here s what the Collection Template file looks like for `author works` ``` Work Title <title> Tags <tags> Author <lookup qauthors> Work Type <worktype> Work Minor Title Work Date <date> Work Link <link> Work Id Work Rights Work Rights Holder Publisher Publisher City Work Notes <body> ``` The `Work Title` field is the one that you will be referencing in order to access this note from your main Collection of quotations so it is important to give some thought to how this field might be composed In my case I m simply using the Title of the work and trusting that each separate cited work will have a unique Title at least for the purposes of my Commonplace book You might choose to use some other coding system involving the author s name and year of publication for example Whatever you decide upon the field must still have a type of `title` but you can label it however you would like Note that I m including an `Author` field here and making this a `lookup` field referring back to the Author Notes Collection we just reviewed You ll see that I m using the Collection shortcut of `qauthors` to tell Notenik where this lookup info may be found I m also using the special Work Type field to indicate what sort of work book interview essay etc is being referenced You may have different informational fields you wish to record about each work these are just the ones I ve chosen to use If you look at this Collection s Settings you should see that a shortcut of `qworks` has been assigned Commonplace Book And now finally we re ready to look at the commonplace book itself I ve called mine `commonplace book` and here s its template file ``` Title <title> Author <lookup qauthors> Date <date> Tags <tags> Work Title <lookup qworks> Work Pages Date Added <dateadded> Body ``` The `Title` field for each quotation is just some brief and meaningful excerpt from the full quotation which goes in the `Body` field just keep in mind that each Note each quotation in this case must have a unique title Note that I m now using `lookup` fields for both `Author` and `Work Title` I could have skipped the inclusion of `Author` here and just pulled it from the `Work Title` lookup but I ve included it explicitly here for a few different reasons + I want to be able to sort the quotations by Author and I wouldn t be able to do this if the Author s name was relegated to a secondary Collection + I want the Author s name to be immediately visible without having to click on a disclosure triangle to reveal it as part of the information about a particular work + In some cases the author of a quotation may be different from the author s of a work for example if the author of a work chooses to quote or cite another author I ve also repeated the `Date` field here for somewhat similar reasons At first glance the field `Work Pages` field may seem like information about a work that could be moved to the Author Works Notes but this is actually meant to call out the pages of the work on which this particular quotation was found and so remains information about the quotation and not about the work more generally Making Use of Your Commonplace Book When viewing one of your quotations on the Display tab you ll see that both of the lookup fields `Author` and `Work Title` appear following disclosure triangles so long as there is some additional info to disclose Click on one of the triangles and you ll see additional info appear that is being pulled from the appropriate Lookup Collection You ll also see that both of the Lookup field values appear as hyperlinks Click on one of these and the corresponding entry in the appropriate Lookup Collection will be opened for you in a separate Collection window This is handy when you wish to add or edit an entry in one of these Lookup Collections Edit one of your quotations and you will see that the Author and the Work Title both appear as drop down menus allowing you to select an existing value from one of these Lookup Collections Summary `Lookup` fields can be used for many more purposes but this project should give you some idea about how to implement them in at least one practical real world example cmn

        content: "I majored in English in college and have maintained a lifelong interest in reading and writing even though I ended up forging a career in software development During the 1990 s I edited authored and published a couple of books printed and bound in the traditional fashion I wrote and formatted these books using Microsoft Word and PageMaker running on my personal Mac But when the Web came along I became fascinated by the new possibilities it offered for many sorts of writing and publishing but especially for book length compositions My first exploration of these possibilities was done with Reason To Rock https www reasontorock com which I originally published in 2001 and I m still pretty happy with the results The tools were sort of clumsy at that early stage but it was great to have a published work that could be updated at any time with hyperlinks with multiple navigation paths through the text and with pages that could be indexed by search engines I started out using Textile as a lightweight markup language and writing with BBEdit I was learning Java around the same time and wrote some software that would pull data from an Excel spreadsheet or a tab delimited file TDF and then fill in some HTML templates using the columns and rows of the spreadsheet And all of that worked pretty well I kept working on my Web publishing software written in Java and used it again when I published The Big Ideas in Software Development https www softdevbigideas com in 2016 My tools had advanced in the intervening years and I now had a version of Notenik written in Java But then the Java language seemed to become less and less of a practical enjoyable tool for writing desktop apps so I rewrote all of the code using Swift And since making the transition the new Notenik has gradually acquired all of the functionality of the Java app plus a lot more Notenik can be readily used as an everyday note taker but in reality much of my motivation to continue with Notenik development has been to build a better and better tool for creating Web books book length compositions that provide the rich depth of a traditional book but also provide hyperlinks both for navigating within a book as well as to outside reference sources along with indexing searching and alternative navigation paths And so the latest Web book I ve been working on is the Notenik Knowledge Base a book length composition about Notenik built using Notenik with all of its recent enhancements and readable using Notenik The whole thing can be easily published in HTML form and can be viewed on the Notenik app https notenik app knowledge base EPUB html notenik knowledge base html website But if you d like to see how it s produced you can also view all the supporting files on GitHub https github com hbowie notenik KB And if you have the Notenik app installed on your Mac you can read the whole thing within Notenik notenik help So where should you start if you d like to produce your own Web book using Notenik Here s a list of some of the key features to explore + Consider how you might want to break up your book length text into sections chapters and or subsections + Use the Seq and Level fields to organize your content into a neatly numbered outline + Use the `Seq + Title` option beneath the `Sort` menu to keep the content sorted using your numbering scheme + Use Wiki Style Links to allow your readers to easily navigate from one chunk of content to another related page + Use the Also Known As field to allow you to easily and naturally refer to related pages via an alternative name for some pages + Tailor Collection Settings to `Format Display for Streamlined Reading` and to not `Include explicit Body field label for Note` This will help make for a more natural reading experience within Notenik and will help you experience your Collection as a linear whole + Tailor the Display in order to change the font options used These same options will be used as defaults if you later Generate a Web Book for your readers + Remember that you can look beneath the `Collection` menu to `Renumber Seq based on Level` in order to straighten out your Seq numbering from time to time + You can also look beneath the `Collection` menu to `Replace Tags based on Seq and Level` This will produce special Tags that allow you to navigate through your content while opening and closing sections of your book using disclosure triangles + You can also Generate a Collection Table of Contents that allows readers to navigate easily through your content + You can also use the Index field to provide an index for your work and generate a Collection Index wherever you like within your Collection + You can also generate a Tags Outline on any page within your Collection + Once you re ready to publish you can use the Generate a Web Book command beneath the `Collection` menu to create folders of HTML and CSS files that will allow your creation to be read within any Web browser + For more control over your output you can add additional Field Labels and Types design your own custom Merge Templates and sort and filter your content in endless ways using Script Files The evolution of the Web over the past several decades has been a reductive arc in many ways with personal expression often being reduced to a series of blog posts or even micro blog posts But if you have something more complex to say intended to be of more enduring interest then you probably want something more like a book And Notenik can help you record and organize your book length content and then share it on the Web leveraging all of the advantages that the Web has to offer when compared to the printed page"

        content: "I ve started using my own Mac app Notenik https notenik app as a project launcher lately and I wanted to share how I ve set this up in case someone else might benefit from it Notenik is available as a free download from the Mac App Store https apps apple com us app notenik id1465997984 I ll try to break this down into a rough sequence of separate steps to make it easier to understand but you don t necessarily need to do all of this in any strict progression 1 Set Notenik to Request Access at Startup Notenik does not require Full Disk Access and it is not set to request it But if you want to use Notenik to its fullest as a project launcher you might want to give it broad access to your files and folders Here s the way I do this In the Notenik Application Settings I set the General Setting of Grant Access to the value At Startup Then whenever I launch Notenik something I usually do once at the start of each day Notenik will prompt me to select a folder to which it should have access I then select my top level user folder hbowie in my case and click Grant Access From that point on Notenik will have access to anything in my user folder and I won t have to worry about any of my launch requests being thwarted due to lack of fresh permissions As an alternative to setting this as a Notenik preference you can just use the Grant Folder Access menu item at any point later to accomplish the same thing 2 Set Up Your Project Launcher Create a New Collection You can store it wherever you like but I placed mine in the Notenik folder within iCloud Drive just to make it easy to access You can initialize it as a Sequenced List However you initialize it though make sure the Link Seq and Level fields are selected in your Collection Settings and then use Collection > Sort to sequence your list by Seq + Title Name it however you like but I called mine Project Launcher just to show that I had no fear of the obvious 3 Make the Project Launcher Essential Use File > Make This Collection Essential so that it automatically opens for you whenever you launch Notenik I then position it in the upper left corner of my screen 4 Add Things You Want to Work On Now start adding notes to your project launcher collection with each note containing a Link to something you might want to work on As a reminder once you ve set a Link for a note you only have to double click on the row for that note in the List tab in order to have Notenik launch that link for you As you add notes you can use the Seq field to keep things in whatever order is most meaningful for you and use the Level field as needed to indent sub items beneath a meaningful heading As you add items to your project launcher consider all of the different kinds of things that Notenik can launch for you 5 Web Locations Starting with the most obvious you can stash a web URL in a Link field in order to later open that site page One easy way to do this is to drag a URL from your web browser s Location Search field into the List tab for your collection If you d like one or more web locations to automatically launch when your Project Launcher collection is opened just give them Tags values of Launch at Startup 6 Other Notenik Collections You can also store the URL to another Notenik collection within a note s Link field For example I have a collection titled To Do that is also stored in the Notenik folder within my iCloud Drive This collection has a Date field and a Recurs field and a Status field and I use it to keep track of things I need to do on a regular basis or on some specific date This used to be my Essential Collection but it now sits at the top of my Project Launcher with a Seq value of 1 So I can just double click on this first row to see a reminder of scheduled tasks that are due today Adding another Notenik collection to your project launcher can be done with three easy steps + Open the collection that you wish to target + Under the Collection menu select the option to Copy Notenik URL for Collection + Back in your project launcher add a new note and then use the Paste command in the Link field to capture the Notenik URL you copied in the prior step Now all you have to do is double click that item in your project launcher collection to open that other collection 7 Custom URL Actions Notenik as well as many other Mac apps have what are known as Custom URL Schemes in which the name of the app appears at the beginning of the URL instead of the usual `https` You can use a launcher note to fire off any of these custom URL actions for Notenik or for any other app 8 Local Files Once you ve created a new note and while you re still on the Edit tab you can use Set Local Link beneath the Note menu to pick a local file that you wish to be opened by the new note For example selecting an Xcode project file will cause that Xcode project to be opened when the Link is launched 9 Notenik Parent Realms A Parent Realm in Notenik is simply an ordinary folder containing possibly within subfolders one or more resources that Notenik might be interested in including + Notenik collections + Notenik scripts + BBEdit project files https bbedit guide netlify app 02 projects index html So within the context of this project launcher discussion a parent realm is a neat way to further organize your projects To create a launcher Note for a parent realm start by using the Open Parent Realm command beneath the File menu and then specify a folder containing one or more of the types of items identified above You will then see the folder open as a sort of pseudo collection in its own window From there you can invoke Copy Note for Collection just as we described above for an ordinary collection and then paste the resulting Link into a new note within your project launcher In my case many of my projects are websites that I ve created with each folder containing the generated HTML as well as Notenik collections scripts and merge templates So I store each website project folder as a separate item to be launched within my project launcher Then once I ve opened the parent realm for a project I can proceed to open items within that parent realm 10 BBEdit Project Files I mentioned above that Notenik will help you open BBEdit project files found within a parent realm Here s the way I use this For each of my major projects ones that I will be launching as parent realms I use BBEdit to create a new project file save it at the top level of my parent realm folder then drag and drop my project folder onto the left side of the BBEdit project window Now when I open a parent realm from my launcher I ll see a BBEdit project file listed and can double click on that to open the entire project folder in BBEdit Then if I later request from Notenik to Text Edit a note or a collection template file that file will open within the BBEdit project window 11 Opening Folders in the Finder It s also worth mentioning that once you have opened a parent realm or a simple collection for that matter you can ask Notenik to open the corresponding folder in the macOS Finder by using Open Folder in Finder beneath the File menu 12 Putting It All Together So here s how I use all of this When I launch Notenik it automatically requests appropriate disk access and I give it permission to access my entire user folder Notenik then automatically opens my project launcher and positions it in the upper left corner of my screen I then leave it there for the rest of the day and come back to it each time I m switching projects My project launcher lists all the things I might want to work on with each note generally pointing to a parent realm aka project folder for that project When I switch my attention from one project to another I close the windows I ve opened for the old project and then open the parent realm window for the new project That window then usually sits with its upper left corner just below and to the right of the upper left corner for my project launcher From there I can open Notenik collections run scripts open the folder in BBEdit and the Finder And then start to get work done on the new project"
