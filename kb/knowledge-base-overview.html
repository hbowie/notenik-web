<p><a href="notenik-knowledge-base.html" class="nav-link">Notenik Knowledge Base</a>&#160;&#8593;</p><h2 id="knowledgebaseoverview">1. Knowledge Base Overview</h2>
<p>This Knowledge Base provides detailed user instruction and reference for all Notenik functionality. </p>

<p>It is meant as a complement to other Notenik documentation. You can find links to all the Notenik docs on the <a href="https://notenik.app/docs.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notenik.app website</a>. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this Knowledge Base is itself a Notenik Collection and, as such, can be viewed in either of two ways: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>As a read-only Collection viewed within Notenik, and accessed from the application&#8217;s Help menu; </p></li>
<li><p>As a <a href="https://notenik.app/kb/notenik-knowledge-base.html" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web book published on the Notenik.app website</a>. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>You will find that this Knowledge Base is all text, without any screen shots. If you&#8217;d like to see what things look like as they are described, I would urge you to download Notenik from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac App Store</a>, and follow along within the app itself. </p>

<p>The Knowledge Base is organized into a number of distinct sections. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you&#8217;re new to Notenik, it&#8217;s best to start with the <a href="application-overview.html" class="wiki-link">Application Overview</a> for a general orientation. </p></li>
<li><p>Once you&#8217;ve downloaded Notenik and are ready to start using it, it&#8217;s worth reviewing the <a href="intro-to-the-user-interface.html" class="wiki-link">Intro to the User Interface</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Then you&#8217;ll probably be ready to learn about <a href="creating-and-tailoring-a-collection-of-notes.html" class="wiki-link">Creating and Tailoring a Collection of Notes</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Once you&#8217;ve created a Collection for yourself, you&#8217;ll be ready to perform some <a href="common-tasks.html" class="wiki-link">Common Tasks</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>The body of each Note is formatted using <a href="markdown.html" class="wiki-link">Markdown</a>, and the Notenik Markdown parser has lots of custom extensions, so you&#8217;ll want to understand how this works. </p></li>
<li><p>If you&#8217;re interested in understanding how Notenik stores its notes on disk, then you&#8217;ll want to read the section on <a href="files-and-folders.html" class="wiki-link">Files and Folders</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Much of the power and flexibility of Notenik comes from its <a href="field-labels-and-types.html" class="wiki-link">Field Labels and Types</a>, so you&#8217;ll want to acquaint yourself with these possibilities as you advance. </p></li>
<li><p>There are many different options when it comes to <a href="getting-data-into-and-out-of-notenik.html" class="wiki-link">Getting Data Into and Out of Notenik</a>, so be sure to review this section if you want to easily import, export, share and/or publish your Notes. </p></li>
<li><p>Notenik also has multiple schemes for <a href="integration.html" class="wiki-link">Integration</a> with other applications. </p></li>
<li><p>For the ultimate flexibility in formatting and exporting your Notes, you will want to take advantage of <a href="merge-templates.html" class="wiki-link">Merge Templates</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>And then, for repeated complex operations including filtering and sorting, you will want to make use of <a href="script-files.html" class="wiki-link">Script Files</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="putting-it-all-together.html" class="wiki-link">Putting It All Together</a> section has a series of articles describing how you can combine various Notenik functions for specific usage scenarios. </p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="reference.html" class="wiki-link">Reference</a> section contains a variety of information pages that you might find useful from time to time. </p></li>
<li><p>And finally, at the very end, you&#8217;ll find a complete <a href="version-history.html" class="wiki-link">Version History</a> of the application, with the latest changes coming first. </p></li>
</ul>
