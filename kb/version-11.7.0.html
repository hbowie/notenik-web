<p>16. <a href="version-history.html" class="nav-link">Version History</a>&#160;&#8593;</p><h3 id="version11.7.0">16.33 Version 11.7.0</h3>
<p>Date: 27 Mar 2023 - Monday</p><h5 id="added-a-text-format-field-type">Added a Text Format Field Type</h5>

<p>A new <a href="text-format.html" class="wiki-link">Text Format</a> field type can be used to specify that the body field for a Note is to be displayed as-is, rather than being run through a Markdown parser. This is especially useful for Notes that use leading white space on a line to indicate levels of indentation within an outline structure. </p>

<h5 id="upgraded-note-selector-to-include-collection-shortcuts">Upgraded Note Selector to Include Collection Shortcuts</h5>

<p>When using the <a href="select-a-note-for-action.html" class="wiki-link">Note Selector</a> to select a Note from another Collection (using a <a href="tailor-collection-settings.html" class="wiki-link">collection shortcut</a>), Notenik will now do a better job of including the target Collection&#8217;s shortcut as part of the generated wiki link or include. </p>

<h5 id="added-a-check-to-prevent-a-note-titled-template-from-being-added">Added a Check to Prevent a Note titled &#8216;Template&#8217; from being Added</h5>

<p>A user recently pointed out that Notenik was not preventing him from adding a Note with a title of &#8216;Template&#8217;, even though such a Note would cause <a href="the-collection-template-file.html" class="wiki-link">the Collection Template File</a> to be overwritten! This has been corrected such that future attempts will be treated in the same way as attempts to create other duplicates, by adding a &#8216;1&#8217; to the end of the Title field. </p>

<h5 id="fixed-some-problems-with-backlinks">Fixed Some Problems with Backlinks</h5>

<p>Fixed a couple of problems affecting <a href="back-links.html" class="wiki-link">Back Links</a>, especially when combined with MultiMarkdown/YAML metadata. </p>

<h5 id="added-web-page-as-a-standard-work-type">Added Web Page as a Standard Work Type</h5>

<p>The value <code>Web Page</code> has been added as a standard <a href="work-type.html" class="wiki-link">Work Type</a>. </p>

<h5 id="added-command-to-generate-a-bibliography">Added Command to Generate a Bibliography</h5>

<p>A new Markdown command to <a href="generate-a-bibliography.html" class="wiki-link">Generate a Bibliography</a> has been added. </p>

<h5 id="added-new-field-type-of-display-seq">Added New Field Type of Display-Seq</h5>

<p>A new field type of <a href="display-seq.html" class="wiki-link">Display Seq</a> has been added. This can be used to complement the presence of a <a href="seq.html" class="wiki-link">Seq</a> field, allowing an author to specify an alternate numbering scheme to be displayed to readers. </p>

<h5 id="heading-centering-can-now-be-set-in-display-settings">Heading Centering Can Now be Set in Display Settings</h5>

<p>The <a href="tailor-the-display.html" class="wiki-link">Display Settings</a> can now be used to optionally center a range of heading levels. </p>

<h5 id="font-family-and-size-can-now-be-separately-set-for-headings">Font Family and Size Can Now be Separately Set for Headings</h5>

<p>The <a href="tailor-the-display.html" class="wiki-link">Display Settings</a> can now be used to specify a font-family, and a size, to be used for all headings. Previously any headings would simply use the same font-family as body text, and a fixed set of sizes. </p>

<h5 id="paragraph-margins-modified">Paragraph Margins Modified</h5>

<p>The CSS styling for paragraphs was modified to reduce the top margin, so that headings can be more closely associated with paragraphs that follow. </p>

<h5 id="added-new-derived-variable">Added New Derived Variable</h5>

<p>Added a new <a href="derived-variables.html" class="wiki-link">Derived Variable</a> called <a href="title-display-slug.html" class="wiki-link">Title Display Slug</a> to wrap a Note title in the appropriate HTML code, based on the <a href="tailor-collection-settings.html" class="wiki-link">Collection Setting</a> used to control <a href="note-title-display.html" class="wiki-link">Note Title Display</a>. </p>

<h5 id="startup-completion-signaled-earlier-in-process">Startup Completion Signaled Earlier in Process</h5>

<p>Each time Notenik launches, it performs a check to ensure that its last launch was successful. If it finds that its last launch was not completed successfully, then Notenik resets its <a href="notenik-settings.html" class="wiki-link">application settings</a> to their default values, in case an errant app setting was causing a crash. </p>

<p>Notenik had been signaling startup completion after an optional chance for the user to Grant Folder Access to some top-level folder, in order to establish broad <a href="disk-access-permissions.html" class="wiki-link">Disk Access Permissions</a>. But if the user had requested this option at startup, but then quit Notenik before dealing with the resulting open panel, then Notenik was incorrectly seeing this as a crash at launch, and hence causing the app settings to be reset. </p>

<p>This has been fixed. </p>
