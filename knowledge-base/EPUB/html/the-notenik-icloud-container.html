<h3 id="the-notenik-icloud-container">4.5 The Notenik iCloud Container</h3>
<p>Starting with Version 3.7.0, Notenik has its own iCloud container. </p>
<p>From the macOS Finder, you can see this container within <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201104">iCloud Drive</a>, appearing as a folder with the unsurprising name of &#8216;Notenik&#8217;. You can tell that this is a container for the app named Notenik, rather than an ordinary folder, by the Notenik app icon overlaid on the normal folder icon. </p>
<p>Within this Notenik iCloud Container, then, you would normally place one or more of your Notenik Collections, each with its own subfolder. </p>
<p>Because macOS knows that this folder is really a container for Notenik documents, it gives Notenik some special privileges here: any Collection stored in this folder can always be accessed by the Notenik app, without you having to explicitly select the Collection to be opened each time. </p>
<p>You can open any of the Collections within the Notenik iCloud Container by using the &#8216;Open from iCloud&#8217; menu beneath the File menu.  </p>
<p>And oh, BTW, if and when a Notenik app for iOS ever appears, this is the folder that will be shared between the Mac and various iOS devices. </p>
