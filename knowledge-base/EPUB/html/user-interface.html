<p>Notenik has a very traditional user interface. If you have been using a Mac for any length of time, then it will probably seem quite straightforward to you. Unlike a lot of modern apps these days, it does not try to look like a Web app, or like something you might see on a phone or a tablet. It has menus and windows and toolbars and tabs and buttons and keyboard shortcuts, and all of these are nicely labeled and in plain sight (unless you choose to hide them). </p>

<p>The main window for a Collection is split into two sides. </p>

<p>The left side shows the complete set of Notes in the Collection. </p>

<p>The right side shows the single, currently selected Note. </p>

<p>The left side has two tabs. </p>

<p>The first tab on the left shows you a simple list of the Notes in your Collection, sorted by one of several available schemes. </p>

<p>The second tab on the left shows you an outline view, with your Notes grouped into the tags that you have assigned to them. </p>

<p>The right side also has two tabs. </p>

<p>The first tab on the right displays the selected Note, with field labels and values, and with the body of the note nicely styled according to its Markdown formatting. </p>

<p>The second tab on the right allows you to edit all of the fields for the selected Note. </p>

<p>You can use either of the tabs on the left to select a particular Note to be displayed (and optionally edited) on the right. </p>
