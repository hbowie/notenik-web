<p>4 <a href="the-notenik-manifesto.html">The Notenik Manifesto</a>&nbsp;&#8593;</p><h3 id="deliver-working-software-frequently">4.15 Deliver Working Software Frequently</h3>
<p>My software development career started early enough, and was long enough, to have seen the gradual rise of <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org">agile practices</a>, as well as the earlier dominance of a more rigidly structured approach that became associated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model">Capability Maturity Models</a>. </p>

<p>I have documented my thoughts about software development pretty thoroughly at the <a href="https://www.softdevbigideas.com">Software Development Big Ideas</a> site. </p>

<p>In the case of Notenik, I&#8217;ve very much embraced the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">principle behind the Agile Manifesto</a> that states: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My general practice has been to release a significant new version of Notenik every couple of weeks, and that seems to be working well, both for me and for the Notenik user community. </p>
