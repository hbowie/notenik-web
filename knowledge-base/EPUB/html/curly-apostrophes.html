<h4 id="curly-apostrophes">6.2.1 Curly Apostrophes</h4>
<p>Curly apostrophes, otherwise known as &#8220;smart&#8221; apostrophes, offer some surprisingly devilish choices, when it comes to implementation by a Markdown parser. </p>
<p>To start with, John Gruber&#8217;s original write-up on his <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">SmartyPants</a> project makes the following notes about apostrophes: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, there is no explicit mention of apostrophes in describing the intentions of his project; they initially  appear to be just lumped in with the topic of curly quotes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, he offers some sympathy for users who really don&#8217;t care whether the apostrophe in &#8220;Joe&#8217;s&#8221; appears as straight or curly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, he notes that, even for those who do care, converting normal ASCII characters to HTML entities may make it more difficult for others wanting to copy and paste text. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fourth, he notes some algorithmic shortcomings: cases in which it is just close to impossible for a parser to figure out whether a single quote character should be made curly. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But even when one wishes to identify a single quote character as an apostrophe, there is some ambiguity built into HTML itself: namely, there is a specific HTML entity hamed <code>&amp;apost;</code>, which is provided to express the intention to display an apostrophe, but this entity reliably renders as simply a straight apostrophe, without any curliness; so if one wishes to show a curly apostrophe, one actually has to request a right single quote character. </p>
<p>This discussion concerning <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html">straight and curly quotes</a> from <em>Buttericks&#8217;s Practical Typography</em> also notes that: &#8220;If you’re tempted to write your own straight-to-curly converter, reconsider &#8212; the good ones cover tricky edge cases that you’re apt to miss on your own.&#8221; </p>
<p>So, taking all of this into consideration, the Notenik Markdown parser now defaults to curly apostrophes (starting with <a href="version-9.0.0.html">Version 9.0.0</a>), but provides an option, on the Collection Preferences screen, to turn this off, in case it is producting results that seem less than useful in a particular context. </p>
<p>If there are edge cases I&#8217;m missing, I&#8217;m also always open to further user feedback on this topic. </p>
