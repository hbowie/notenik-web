<p>HTML and the World-Wide Web have become so ubiquitous in our modern world &#8211; and have also been so debased through their usage for crass commercial purposes &#8211; that it is hard now to remember the original miracle. </p>

<p>It may help to recount my own personal history of writing tools. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I started out with pen or pencil and paper, and cursive penmanship &#8211; a subject in school that merited a barely passing grade for me. Nonetheless, I started writing early, and enjoyed the process. </p></li>
<li><p>I started typing in college, using a typewriter with the hunt and peck approach, having never been taught how to use a keyboard in any sort of efficient or effective manner. </p></li>
<li><p>I finally learned touch-typing in an adult education class that I took in the autumn following my graduation from college. </p></li>
<li><p>When I started professional programming, I wrote things down &#8211; again, using pen or pencil &#8211; on paper coding sheets that were then given to a group of keypunch operators so that they could translate my hen scratchings onto punched cards. </p></li>
<li><p>My first personal computer was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_1">Osborne 1</a> that came with a copy of WordStar, my first Word Processor application. It was relatively primitive by today&#8217;s standards but, when accompanied by an early dot-matrix printer, it actually allowed a user to make corrections and other changes, and to print out a copy to share with others whenever needed. </p></li>
<li><p>And then further refinements followed, culminating in MS Word, laser printers and PDF documents. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>But then, HTML and the Web came along, providing all of the following improvements. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>HTML documents could be authored and edited and read using any of a number of different software applications, running on pretty much any computing platform. </p></li>
<li><p>HTML is written using plain text, so anyone could see how HTML documents were constructed, and could even write software to generate their own HTML docs. </p></li>
<li><p>HTML documents could be published on the Web, instead of on paper, providing access to anyone on the Internet. </p></li>
<li><p>HTML docs did not have to be formatted to be printed on a particular page size &#8211; instead, they could reflow dynamically to fit whatever output size the reader preferred, even allowing the reader to adjust the font size dynamically. </p></li>
<li><p>HTML documents could be easily updated at any time &#8211; even in their published form! &#8211; making ongoing corrections and improvements a possibility. </p></li>
<li><p>Each HTML document published to the Web was assigned its own unique and unchanging address, making it easy for others to reference and share. </p></li>
<li><p>One HTML document could link to others! </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Probably any one or two of these would have been enough to convince me that HTML documents were an improvement over word processing files, but all seven&#8230;?! Why would anyone <em>not</em> use HTML, once it became available? </p>

<p>And so, Notenik uses HTML internally to format its display of a Note, and also makes it easy to use your Notes to generate HTML, and create web pages, and even an entire website. </p>
