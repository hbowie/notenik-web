<h3 id="overview">1.2 Overview</h3>
<p>Notenik is a system for recording, storing, organizing, viewing and publishing Notes. </p>
<p>Notenik is available as a Mac App that can be downloaded from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>. There is no up-front cost, nor any in-app purchases, nor any subscription required, in order to download and fully use all of Notenik&#8217;s features. </p>
<p>Each Note is stored in its own text file. </p>
<p>A folder full of Notes is referred to as a Collection, and a user may have as many Collections as desired, and Collections may be stored in a variety of locations. Collections can be synced to the cloud, and/or to other devices, using services such as Dropbox and iCloud. You can use any text editor, on any platform, to view and edit your Notes. Notenik formats each text file in a simple, straightforward way that is easily read by humans. </p>
<p>One special feature of Notenik is the liberal and flexible use of Fields. In Notenik, a Note&#8217;s Title and its Body are distinct fields. A Link field and a Tags field are available by default. Other field names, and field types, can be easily added. Each Collection can be tailored to have its own set of <a href="field-labels-and-types.html">Field Labels and Types</a>. For example, add a Date field, a Status field and a Recurs field, and you have a simple but very workable To Do list. </p>
<p>Each Collection can be sorted in a variety of different ways, and an outline view is always available to let you explore your collection via Tags. </p>
<p><a href="markdown.html">Markdown</a> is supported in the Body field, as well as in other fields of type <a href="longtext.html">longtext</a>. Several extensions to basic Markdown are supported, including <a href="wiki-style-links.html">wiki-style links</a> from one Note to another. </p>
<p>Notenik offers several ways to get Note data into and out of Notenik, in a variety of different formats. </p>
<p>Notenik also has its own templating language. You can create <a href="merge-templates.html">Merge Templates</a>, using your preferred text editor, and can then merge the Notes and their Fields into one or more templates in order to create output text files &#8211; most typically, HTML files. </p>
<p>Notenik also has its own scripting language, You can record, modify, and/or write <a href="script-files.html">Script Files</a> that will filter and sort one or more Collections and then merge the resulting data into one or more template files, to create a variety of output files. </p>
<p>By creatively combining different fields, scripting parameters, and merge templates, Notenik can be used as a static site generator to create an entire website. </p>
