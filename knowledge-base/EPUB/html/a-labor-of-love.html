<p>I enjoy working on Notenik. I enjoy using it. I enjoy getting feedback from users, and it gives me a warm feeling to know that others are finding the software useful. I&#8217;m fortunate to be in a position that allows me to give back to others in some small way without needing renumeration. </p>
<p>Additionally, trying to optimize an app in order to maximize revenues and profits, in today&#8217;s markets, are motivations that often seem to negatively influence an app&#8217;s development trajectory, </p>
<p>And so Notenik is available for free, and the programming code is all open source and available on GitHub. </p>
