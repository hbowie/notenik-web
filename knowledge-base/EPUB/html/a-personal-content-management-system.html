<p>This seems as good a time as any to make a small confession. I have a lot of history working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database</a> systems, and also with web <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content management systems</a>, such as <a href="https://www.drupal.org" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drupal</a>. So when I originally started writing Notenik, several things seemed very natural to me: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Thinking of a Note as an object, or an entity, or a row in a table, or a record, depending on your preferred terminology. </p></li>
<li><p>Thinking of every value associated with a Note as having its own field name (aka label, or column heading). </p></li>
<li><p>Having different types of fields available, each with its own intended usage and functionality. </p></li>
<li><p>Different Collections of Notes each having their own sets of associated field names and types. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>And so, in some ways, Notenik is as much a small, text-based, personal database application (akin to the early versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FileMaker</a>) as it is anything else. </p>

<p>Keeping this lineage in mind may help you understand some of the thinking behind Notenik, and some of its potential uses, as you continue with your exploration of the product. </p>
