<p>14 <a href="version-history.html">Version History</a>&nbsp;&#8593;</p><h3 id="version-9.7.0">14.4 Version 9.7.0</h3>
<p>Date: 05 Jul 2022</p><h5 id="system-appearance-preserved-in-generated-css">System Appearance Preserved in Generated CSS</h5>

<p>Beginning with <a href="version-8.7.0.html">Version 8.7.0</a> the user has been able to explicitly set a light or dark appearance for Notenik, overriding whatever the System Setting might be. However, whenever Notenik was generating CSS for use outside of Notenik (or within a sample <code>display.css</code> file), that CSS would still default to the general System appearance. This change fixes that, so that the generated CSS will be based on the user&#8217;s current wishes, as expressed by the <strong>App Appearance</strong> setting on the <strong>General</strong> tab of the <strong>Notenik Preferences</strong>. </p>

<h5 id="share-menu-item-renamed">Share Menu Item Renamed</h5>

<p>The <strong>Share</strong> option beneath the <strong>Note</strong> menu has been renamed to <strong>Share w/Options</strong>, to help distinguish it from the <strong>Share</strong> button on the Toolbar. </p>

<h5 id="better-looking-html">Better-Looking HTML</h5>

<p>The HTML code produced by Notenik has been prettified a bit, with better spacing at the beginning of lines, and better line breaks and spacing before and after block tags. No changes were made that would affect the HTML syntax. </p>

<h5 id="indent-spacing-on-the-list-tab-is-now-adjustable">Indent Spacing on the List Tab is Now Adjustable</h5>

<p>When viewing a Collection containing a <a href="level.html">level</a> field, and when viewing the List of Notes sorted by <strong>Seq + Title</strong>, the title of each Note will be indented to indicate the level of each particular Note within the implied outline. </p>

<p>The default is to indent one space per level, but with this change the spacing can be adjusted on the <strong>General</strong> tab of the <strong>Notenik Preferences</strong>. </p>

<h5 id="new-collection-title-taken-from-folder-name">New Collection Title Taken from Folder Name</h5>

<p>When creating a new Collection, the Collection title will be initially set to the folder name of the Collection. (It was previously being set to the name of the model Collection used to initialize the new Collection, but I had never intended to leave it this way.) </p>

<h5 id="import-logic-modified-slightly">Import Logic Modified Slightly</h5>

<p>When performing an <a href="import-and-export-your-notes.html">import</a> operation, and importing a folder of text files, Notenik will now suspend its usual requirement that all desired fields be already defined for the Collection, and will instead add any new fields found in the input source, but not already defined for the Collection. This is consistent with the general principle to &#8220;Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others&#8221; (often referred to as Postel&#8217;s Law). </p>

<h5 id="several-knowledge-base-typos-corrected">Several Knowledge Base Typos Corrected</h5>

<p>Thanks to J.G. for reporting these! </p>
