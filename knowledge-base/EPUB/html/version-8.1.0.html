<h1>11.5 Version 8.1.0</h1>
<p>Date: 22 Jan 2022</p>
<h5 id="added-an-include-quote-body-option-for-markdown-inclusion">Added an Include-Quote-Body option for Markdown Inclusion</h5>
<p>When using the Markdown extension to <a href="include-a-note-or-file.html">Include a Note or File</a> within the body of a Note, the style <code>quotebody</code> can now be used to pull in the body of a second Note, formatted as a blockquote, but without any attempt at attribution. </p>
<h5 id="exclude-included-notes-from-list-of-included-children">Exclude Included Notes from list of Included Children</h5>
<p>If you use a command to <a href="include-a-note-or-file.html">Include a Note or File</a> within the body of a Note, then Notenik will now exclude that same Note from being displayed within a list of included children that might be displayed following the parent Note. </p>
<h5 id="exclude-toc-page-from-table-of-contents">Exclude ToC Page from Table of Contents</h5>
<p>When you <a href="generate-a-collection-table-of-contents.html">Generate a Collection Table of Contents</a>, the page on which the ToC appears will no longer itself be included in the generated Table. </p>
<h5 id="enhanced-tags-display">Enhanced Tags Display</h5>
<p>For a Collection sorted by Seq, the Seq value will now appear on the Tags tab, preceding each Note's title. </p>
<h5 id="sorted-out-some-problems-with-model-collections">Sorted Out Some Problems with Model Collections</h5>
<p>Straightened out some inconsistencies in how model Collections (including the Notenik Intro) are handled. </p>
