<p>Released on 04 Dec 2019 </p>

<h5 id="fixed-bug-in-persisting-the-sort-reverse-setting">Fixed Bug in Persisting the Sort Reverse Setting</h5>

<p>Notenik had been resetting the Reverse setting each time a Collection was opened. </p>

<h5 id="eliminated-option-to-generate-sample-reports-for-help-notes">Eliminated Option to Generate Sample Reports for Help Notes</h5>

<p>App Store testers correctly pointed out that selecting this option for the Help Notes would cause a crash. </p>

<h5 id="suppressed-empty-tags-from-favorites-to-html-export">Suppressed Empty Tags from Favorites to HTML Export</h5>

<p>You can sometimes end up with empty tags in a collection, as a result of deleting notes or changing tags. Previously these would be included when creating a Favorites page, but they are now suppressed. </p>

<h5 id="moved-reload-collection-command-from-file-menu-to-collection-menu">Moved Reload Collection Command from File Menu to Collection Menu</h5>

<p>The Reload Collection command will hopefully be easier to find beneath the Collection menu. </p>

<h5 id="added-support-for-favourites-in-addition-to-favorites">Added Support for &#8216;Favourites&#8217; in addition to &#8216;Favorites&#8217;</h5>

<p>Based on feedback from a user in Australia, added support for the British spelling of &#8216;Favourites&#8217;. </p>

<h5 id="added-cut-copy-and-paste-support-for-notes">Added Cut, Copy and Paste Support for Notes</h5>

<p>The Cut, Copy and Paste commands — along with their corresponding keyboard shortcuts — are now enabled on the Edit menu for Notes. After selecting a Note, the Cut or Copy commands may be used to cut/copy the entire note. The note is copied to the clipboard as text, so that it can then be pasted into any application where text is accepted — including, but not limited to, Notenik itself. Be aware that the user should be on the Display Tab, and not the Edit tab, in order to perform these note-based functions since, when on the Edit tab, cut/copy/paste will typically apply to the text within a field, and not to the entire note. </p>
