<p>If you use <a href="wiki-style-links.html">Wiki-Style Links</a> extensively, then over time you may wish to see a summary view of what <em>links</em> to what, and what <em>is linked to</em> from what. </p>

<p>Notenik provides these views via a couple of special fields. </p>

<p>The first field is called Wiki Links, and it provides a summarized list of all the forward links found within the body of each Note. </p>

<p>The second field is called Back Links, and it provides a summarized list of all the other Notes that link to the Note being viewed. </p>

<p>If you choose Back Links for a Collection, then the Wiki Links field will also be enabled. </p>

<p>Both of these fields, when present, are automatically maintained for you by Notenik. </p>

<p>You can include these fields on any Collection that you like, but they are not present by default. </p>

<p>Some comparable apps present this information via a <em>graph</em>, or a graphic view where lines represent connections, and dots represent connected notes. Notenik does not offer such a view. </p>
