<h3 id="version-1.9.0">11.90 Version 1.9.0</h3>
<p>Released on 11 Nov 2019 </p>
<h5 id="fixed-a-note-delete-bug">Fixed a Note Delete Bug</h5>
<p>A note that was being deleted would sometimes be immediately re-added. This has been corrected. </p>
<h5 id="fixed-an-attachments-bug">Fixed an Attachments Bug</h5>
<p>Attachments were being deleted when the parent Note&#8217;s title was changed. This has now been corrected. </p>
<h5 id="added-option-to-reverse-the-sort">Added Option to Reverse the Sort</h5>
<p>An option has been added to the Sort menu that will allow the user to reverse the current sequence of the list (from ascending to descending, or vice-versa). </p>
<h5 id="scripter-can-now-read-markdown-headers">Scripter Can Now Read Markdown Headers</h5>
<p>Added a new input format to read a Markdown file and chunk it up into sections, based on its headers. Each resulting row of data will consist of fhe following fields: </p>
<ul>
<li>Title - The text content of the header </li>
<li>Level - The level of the header (1 - 6) </li>
<li>Body - All of the text following the header, up to the next header. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the resulting data can be used to generate a Table of Contents for the Markdown file, using an appropriately formatted template. </p>
