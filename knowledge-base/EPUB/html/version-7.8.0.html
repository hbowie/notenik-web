<h1>11.2 Version 7.8.0</h1>
<p>Date: 13 Dec 2021</p>
<h5 id="improvements-to-web-book-publishing">Improvements to Web Book Publishing</h5>
<p>When you <a href="export-as-web-book.html">generate a Web Book</a>, you can now provide a file named <code>header.html</code>, to specify HTML code to be placed at the top of each generated web page. The process has also been modified so that a <code>Level</code> field need not be used. </p>
<h5 id="new-notenik-intro-provided">New Notenik Intro Provided</h5>
<p>A new Introduction to Notenik is available. New users will see a copy of this in their iCloud Drive when they first launch Notenik. It can also be found on the <a href="https://notenik.app/intro/EPUB/html/welcome-to-notenik.html">Notenik.app</a> website. The copy on the website includes screenshots, for those who'd like to see what the app looks like before downloading it. </p>
<h5 id="new-include-children-field-type-added">New <code>Include Children</code> Field Type Added</h5>
<p>When using Streamlined Reading mode, the new <a href="include-children.html">Include Children</a> field can be used to pull child elements of a Note into the parent Note's display. </p>
<h5 id="added-a-date-sort-option">Added a Date Sort Option</h5>
<p>You can now sort a Collection by its primary (or only) Date field, irrespective of its Status value. The Seq field will be included in the sort, following Date, if a Seq field is defined for the Collection. The Title field will be the final field included in the sort key for this option. </p>
