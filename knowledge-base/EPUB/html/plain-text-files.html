<p>4 <a href="the-notenik-manifesto.html">The Notenik Manifesto</a>&nbsp;&#8593;</p><h3 id="plain-text-files">4.12 Plain Text Files</h3>
<p>Notenik stores all of its data &#8211; including your Notes, but also configuration info &#8211; in plain text files stored on your Mac, in ordinary folders. </p>

<p>As a practical matter, this means that Notenik data: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Can be viewed and modified using any text editor; </p></li>
<li><p>Can be copied, synced and stored using pretty much any computing platform; </p></li>
<li><p>Can be easily read and written using just about any programming language; </p></li>
<li><p>Will always be available and accessible, without having to worry about complex, proprietary and largely closed document or database formats, or mysterious storage locations. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these very sensible reasons, I&#8217;m also partial to plain text files based on these more personal preferences: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I dislike all the hard lines that modern computing tends to draw between developers and users, and am much more comfortable with a sort of middle ground that can be shared by both camps; </p></li>
<li><p>I tend to think of text file viewing and manipulation as the keys to the computing kingdom, and that everyone using a computer &#8211; especially a device with a dedicated keyboard &#8211; should be comfortable using a text editor; </p></li>
<li><p>Just as my father and engineers of his generation were comfortable &#8220;popping the hood&#8221; on their cars in order to tinker with the engines, I think Notenik users should be able to look under the hood to see what Notenik is doing, and tweak things if they desire. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the ability to open and edit Notenik data using a text editor can also get the user into a bit of hot water at times, but I like to think, as Jesse Winchester apparently did, that <em><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-reasonable-amount-of-trouble/909295280">A Reasonable Amount of Trouble</a></em> is to be expected, and in fact can be part of the joy of the journey. </p>
