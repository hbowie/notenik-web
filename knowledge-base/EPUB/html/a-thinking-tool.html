<p>I find that reading, writing and thinking all tend to be pretty tightly bound together for me. I often get new thoughts from reading, and often clarify and integrate my thoughts by writing. </p>

<p>The way I do this is by collecting scraps &#8211; quotations, ideas, short bits or original writing &#8211; and then gradually weaving them together into some kind of cohesive whole. </p>

<p>This is basically the process I used on <a href="https://reasontorock.com">Reason to Rock</a>, and it&#8217;s worked pretty well for me since then. </p>

<p>And although Notenik is flexible enough to be used for many kinds of Notes, its most important use for me &#8211; its critical mission, if you will &#8211; is to help me think more clearly. </p>
