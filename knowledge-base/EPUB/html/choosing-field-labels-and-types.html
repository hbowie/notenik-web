<p>In Notenik, each Collection of Notes contains a template file. By customizing this file &#8211; either through the Notenik Collection Preferences, or via your favorite text editor &#8211; you can control the sorts of fields expected to be contained in a Collection: by modifying the list of expected field labels, as well as the expected <em>type</em> for each field. </p>

<p>Different field types present different sorts of editing widgets and varying kinds of displays, and also have different sets of functionality associated with them. </p>

<p>To a large extent you can mix and match these different field types to achieve your particular purpose for a Collection. </p>

<p>Notenik currently recognizes thirty-seven distinct field types. </p>

<p>Among the most common are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Title - The Title of the Note </li>
<li>AKA - <em>Also Known As</em>, to provide an alias for wiki links </li>
<li>Body - The Note text itself </li>
<li>Date - A due date, or a publication date, as examples </li>
<li>Recurs - A recurs rule for repeating a dated note </li>
<li>Status - Draft, Published, Canceled, etc. </li>
<li>Seq - An arbitrary sequence number, or priority level </li>
<li>Level - The intended indention level for a note within a sequenced Collection </li>
<li>Link - A link to a website, or to a local file or app </li>
<li>Tags - Custom labels implementing any sort of categorization scheme </li>
<li>Timestamp - A unique identifier that won&#8217;t change if a Note is renamed </li>
</ul>
