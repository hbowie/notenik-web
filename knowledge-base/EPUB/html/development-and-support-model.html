<p>I&#8217;m a solo programmer who is developing Notenik for fun, as a hobby, and for my own use. </p>

<p>Users with questions, comments or suggestions can <a href="mailto:support@notenik.app">email me directly</a> and (so far, at least), I generally respond within a day or two. </p>

<p>About half of the improvements to the app start with my own ideas, while the other half begin with input from an existing or prospective user. </p>

<p>The Mac-native version of Notenik had its first release a little over two years ago, and on average I&#8217;ve been releasing a new version, with some significant improvements, every couple of weeks. My intent is to maintain this sort of pace into the foreseeable future. </p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, Notenik is open-source and the code is freely available for others to view and improve upon. </p>
