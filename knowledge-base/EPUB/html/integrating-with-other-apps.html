<p>Notenik has its own custom URL scheme, meaning that you can type a URL starting with <code>notenik://</code>, followed by a valid Notenik command, and then, by following that link from another application, can get Notenik to do something for you: open a Collection, open a particular Note, add a new Note, etc. </p>

<p>Notenik also provides menu commands to easily generate custom URLs linking to selected Notes within a Notenik Collection. </p>

<p>Notenik also has a special Link field, and you can use that to fire off custom URLs for other apps &#8211; or, for Notenik itself, for that matter. </p>

<p>Although Notenik is not scriptable via AppleScript in the classic sense, it does implement a number of custom AppleScript commands designed to support integration with other apps &#8211; most notably, <a href="https://hookproductivity.com">Hook</a>. Hook integration scripts for Notenik are now available to Hook users via their official channels.  </p>

<p>Notenik also offers some custom actions for use with Shortcuts for the Mac. </p>
