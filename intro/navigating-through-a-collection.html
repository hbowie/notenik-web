<p id="navigating-through-a-collection"><strong>6 Navigating through a Collection</strong></p><img src="images/navigating-through-a-collection-screenshot.png" alt="" /><p>If you look beneath the Nav menu, you&#8217;ll find a number of ways to navigate through a Collection, in addition to scrolling and clicking within the List tab. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Next in Seq &#8211; Simply advances from one Note to the next, using whatever Sort order is currently being used. </p></li>
<li><p>Prior in Seq &#8211; Simply retreats from one Note to the previous one, again using the current Sort order. </p></li>
<li><p>Search &#8211; This will position your cursor within the Search field in the Toolbar. Enter a string of text here, and press Enter or Return to find the first Note containing that string within one of the fields being searched. </p></li>
<li><p>Advanced Search &#8211; This will bring up a separate window allowing you greater control over some aspects of your search. Note that, after tweaking one or more options here, doing a simple Search will make use of these same options. </p></li>
<li><p>Search Next &#8211; After finding the first Note matching your search criteria, use this command to go from the last Note found to the next matching Note. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Again, feel free to take advantage of the keyboard shortcuts associated with each of these menu options. </p>

<p>Also, note that the three leftmost buttons on the toolbar allow you to navigate home (to the first Note), to the prior Note, and to the next Note. </p>
