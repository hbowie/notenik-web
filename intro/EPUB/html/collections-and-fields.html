<p><strong>2 Collections and Fields</strong></p>
<p>Before exploring Notenik's User Interface with you, I'd like to briefly touch on a couple of ways in which Notenik may be different from other note-taking apps you might be used to. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Collections</strong> &#8211; Rather than assuming that you want all of your Notes to be stored in a single repository, Notenik groups your Notes into Collections. You can have as many or as few Collections as you would like, and each Collection may be stored anywhere you like. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fields</strong> &#8211; Each Note has multiple fields, of different types. At a minimum, a Note will have a Title and a Body. But many other field names, and field types, are possible. And each different Collection of Notes can have a different set of fields defined and available for each Note in that Collection. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, with those two important concepts in our hip pocket, let's begin exploring the Notenik user interface. </p>
