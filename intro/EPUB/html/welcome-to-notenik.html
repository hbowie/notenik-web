<p><strong>1 Welcome to Notenik!</strong></p>
<p>This brief intro is designed to be both a tutorial and a workshop for learning some of the Notenik basics. That is, this intro is itself a Notenik Collection containing instructions on the use of Notenik; but it is a disposable copy that you can modify however you would like, so all of the editing capabilites of Notenik will be available to you as you step through the tutorial.  </p>
<p>When you install and launch Notenik for the first time, this intro will typically be the first thing you see. </p>
<p>(You can also find a read-only copy of this intro on the <a href="https://notenik.app/intro/EPUB/html/welcome-to-notenik.html">Notenik.app website</a>.) </p>
