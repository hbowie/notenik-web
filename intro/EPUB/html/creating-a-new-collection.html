<p><strong>15 Creating a New Collection</strong></p>
<p>To create a New Collection, select <code>New Collection&#8230;</code> beneath the <code>File</code> menu. </p>
<p>You will then be walked through a series of screens. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first screen will ask you to specify the general <strong>Location</strong> of your new Collection. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are signed into iCloud, then you can select <code>The Notenik folder within iCloud Drive</code>, which is generally the easiest option. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise you can select <code>A location of your choosing</code>, which will allow you to locate your new Collection folder anywhere you like within your file system (in your <code>Documents</code> folder, for example). If you choose this option, you will then see a standard macOS Open dialog, allowing you to choose the parent folder in which your new Collection will be created. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next you'll be prompted for the <strong>Name</strong> of your new Collection. This will become the name of the folder in which your Notes will be stored. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then you'll be able to choose the set of <strong>Fields</strong> that will be available within your Collection. You'll be able to select a general type of Collection, and each type will have a set of associated fields. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, your new Collection will be created, and you will be presented with the Collection Preferences screen. You can use this screen to add or remove fields, and/or modify the other Collection settings. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you hit the <code>OK</code> button, your new Collection will be ready for use. </p>
