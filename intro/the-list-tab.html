<p id="the-list-tab"><strong>5 The List Tab</strong></p><img src="images/the-list-tab-screenshot.jpg" alt="" /><p>Beneath the Toolbar (which we&#8217;ll talk about later), you&#8217;ll see that the Collection window is divided into two sides. The left side shows all of the Notes in your Collection, while the right side focuses on one Note at a time. </p>

<p>Starting on the left side, you&#8217;ll see two tabs at the top, with the first one labeled List. This tab shows all of the Notes in your Collection, listed in a particular order. </p>

<p>If you look beneath the Collection menu, and then beneath the Sort menu, you&#8217;ll see a number of different options. This Intro Collection is  sorted by Seq + Title, which is useful in order to maintain the Notes in a particular order. But you can choose any of the other available options (assuming that your particular Collection defines the fields to be used in the sort). When you select a different Sort order, then the List tab will immediately be reconfigured to reflect your choice. </p>

<p>Note that a number of different Sort options are available, but that the sorting is not infinitely configurable. You can&#8217;t, for example, simply click on a column heading to sort by that particular field. This is simply a design choice: one that makes Notenik more flexible than the typical note-taking application, but less flexible than a full-fledged database or spreadsheet app. </p>

<p>You&#8217;ll see that clicking on a row on the List tab will bring up the corresponding Note on the right. </p>
