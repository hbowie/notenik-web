<p id="creating-a-new-collection"><strong>15 Creating a New Collection</strong></p><p>To create a New Collection, select New Collection beneath the File menu. </p>

<p>You will then be walked through a series of screens. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first screen will ask you to specify the general <strong>Location</strong> of your new Collection. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are signed into iCloud, then you can select The Notenik folder within iCloud Drive, which is generally the easiest option. </p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise you can select A location of your choosing, which will allow you to locate your new Collection folder anywhere you like within your file system (in your Documents folder, for example). If you choose this option, you will then see a standard macOS Open dialog, allowing you to choose the parent folder in which your new Collection will be created. </p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Next you&#8217;ll be prompted for the <strong>Name</strong> of your new Collection. This will become the name of the folder in which your Notes will be stored. </p></li>
<li><p>Then you&#8217;ll be able to choose the set of <strong>Fields</strong> that will be available within your Collection. You&#8217;ll be able to select a general type of Collection, and each type will have a set of associated fields. </p></li>
<li><p>At this point, your new Collection will be created, and you will be presented with the Collection Settings screen. You can use this screen to add or remove fields, and/or modify the other Collection settings. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you hit the OK button, your new Collection will be ready for use. </p>
